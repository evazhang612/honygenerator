I remember everything because I’ve obsessively thought about it.  She was my roommate's girlfriend.  We were alone in the house. There were vibes between us. We’d been flirting.  We sat on the edge of the bed for half an hour before anything happened. Smiling.  Giggling.  I kissed her, then we stopped.  She kissed me, then we stopped. Then she put the condom on me.  Afterward we cuddled. We joked. We discussed whether we should tell my roommate. And I thought that was it.  Then a few weeks later, a mutual friend showed me a text message where someone referred to me as a rapist.  When I confronted the girl about it, she claimed the sex hadn’t been consensual, and her willingness had just been a defense mechanism.  That’s when the bottom fell out of my life.  It felt like my reputation was ruined.  It seemed like everyone knew.  I got on antidepressants.  I went to therapy.  I felt hated, not lovable, not welcome in polite society.  Nothing I did seemed to matter anymore.  Certain pathways in my life seemed completely closed off. I could never be famous. Never a public figure. Never a CEO. The rumor would certainly come out. I had these constant, obsessive thoughts about what I’d do if it ever went public. Would I sue her?  Release every communication we’d ever had? Get statements from all my ex-girlfriends? Would I post a long note on Facebook where I admitted to every sin I’ve ever committed?  Maybe that would convince people that I’d never lie about this.  Would any of these things even matter?  Or would it just matter what she said?
I was a teller at a bank.  I was working the front and couldn’t talk on the phone, so she sent me a text.  She sent two texts actually.  The first one said ‘I’m pregnant.’  And the second one said: ‘It’s twins.’  We weren’t even living together at that point.  I was only making $28,000 a year.  I wasn’t ready.  They were born three months premature.  But if my wife was scared, she never showed it.  She went from nothing to Mom in no time.  She told me exactly what to do.  It was never domineering.  She just knew.  The first months were terrible.  We were sleeping two hours a night.  I was waking up for work at seven.  It felt like I was living in a dream state.  And I kept thinking: ‘I don’t think I can do this.’  And that feeling stayed for a long time.  Things are a bit easier now.  But it never feels like I’m done.  I go to work, then come home, then it’s homework, then it’s bed.  I’m dead tired at the end of the day.  I don’t know if I’m doing a good job.  I never felt like Dad.  I just felt like some figure they called ‘Dad.’  It somehow felt like my wife was their mom, and I was just there for support.  I felt like a babysitter.  Like I was watching someone else’s kids.  I never knew what a dad was supposed to be like.  It wasn’t in me.  I didn’t know how to show it.  I took care of them.  I loved them.  But I didn’t really hug or kiss them.  I wasn’t comfortable with it.  Probably because it was never done to me.  But I’m different now.  I hug and kiss them every night.  But that’s because they taught me.  They’d come up to me and say ‘Daddy, I love you.’  And they’d hug me and kiss me.  So that’s what I do now.  But it didn’t come from me.  Everything came from them.
I’m from a town with one traffic light.  It’s mostly antique shops.  There aren’t really any bars and all the restaurants close by eight.  So there’s not much opportunity socially or professionally.  I thought I’d have a house by now.  And a wife.  And kids.  But I’m still living in my parent’s basement.  Mostly it’s to save money and pay off loans, but it’s also comfortable.  My family is Italian.  We eat dinner together every Sunday.  My sisters bring their families over, and I get to see my nieces and nephews.  Everyone I love is there.  It’s really important to me.  A couple years back I had an opportunity to work in Chicago, but I turned it down.  I told them my family needs me, which is the perfect excuse. Because who’s going to question it?  But I don’t think it was the real reason.  I think I’m leaning on my family to avoid taking risks.  Every night when I come home, my dinner is waiting for me.  I don’t have to struggle.  I don’t have to progress and grow and get past problems.  I’m beginning to feel stagnant.  So I already told my boss: once an opportunity comes to move to the west coast, I’m taking it.
My mother ruled the house.  Everything had to be in its place and orderly.  There were plastic coverings on the sofa and armchairs.   She cleaned every day and I had to help her.  She was like a drill sergeant.  She told me when to wake up.  She told me when to go to sleep.  I don’t remember having interactions with her that weren’t her telling me what to do.  And if I resisted, she’d lash out physically.  She’d push me around.  She’d hit me in the face.  My only escape was reading.  After school I’d explore the stacks in the library, pick random books off the shelf, and choose anything that I found interesting.  I’d check out as many books as I could carry.  Back then you were allowed to keep them out for four weeks.  I’d read in my bedroom, in the bathroom, at the dinner table.  Books removed me from that toxic environment.  They exposed me to different worlds, different ways of thinking, different points of view.  I began to do really well in school.  I skipped grades.  On the citywide tests, I scored in the 99th percentile for vocabulary and reading comprehension.  My mother resented it all.  She’d call me an ‘educated moron.’  I went to City College at sixteen.  Graduated at nineteen.  Then after graduation, I used all my savings to travel to Paris for a month.  I explored the city.  I visited museums.  I met so many people from so many countries.  And by the time I came home, I had everything planned out: I found a job, found an apartment, and waited for my parents to visit their country home.  Then I packed up my things and left.
We’d get in these blowout fights whenever she asked me to stop drinking.  She’d try to tell me to slow down. Or that my behavior was ridiculous.  Or that she loved me and she wanted me to be healthy.  But it just seemed like she was trying to interfere with my life.  Your own selfishness becomes completely invisible when you’re that addicted.  And the more a person cares, the more they become an obstacle.  It’s horrible because you start hating them for loving you.  It would be so much easier to escape if nobody cared.  But somehow she stayed.  It’s hard to imagine why because she had every reason to go.  But this summer we’re getting married.  And I’ll be three years sober this April.
You can do things when you’re six that you can’t do when you’re three like my little sister is.  One thing is ice skate I guess, which I’ve done like maybe two times.  I fell down a lot and it felt kinda frustrating because it’s kinda frustrating when you keep falling but you have to keep your eyes open even if you’re scared.  On the fifth or seventh time around I didn’t even fall and I even did a fancy twirl jump but not in real life just in my imagination.
I’m not sure if you’ve heard about the accident at South By Southwest a few years back.  A car plowed into a crowd of pedestrians.  Four people died.  Twenty-five were injured.  I was the twenty-fifth.  I broke my back and neck in four places.  The driver was fleeing from the police in a stolen car.  He was twenty-one years old.  His name was Rashad.  A lot of people in my life thought he should get the death penalty.  But I never had strong feelings about it.  Maybe I disconnected from my emotions.  Maybe it’s just my personality.  But I mostly just felt sad that he’s so young and he’ll be in jail for the rest of his life.  Recently I looked up the address of his prison.  I purchased a PO Box.  And I wrote him three letters.  I’ve held onto them for months without sending them.  I guess I’m struggling with the fact that empathy is a privilege.  I’m still alive.  I’m still able to walk.  There are people who lost more than me who might be upset that I’m showing him any compassion at all.  But I find it curious that I know nothing about somebody who had such a profound impact on my life.  All three letters begin the exact same way: ‘We’ve never met, but we were in the same place at the same time.’  I’m not sure what I’m looking for.  I just figure there’s something to be said.  And I’d like to figure out what that is.
My dad came to America in the 90’s.  He worked at one of those stalls on 34th street selling ‘I Love New York’ t-shirts and plastic Statues of Liberty.  One of his coworkers had a sister back in Bangladesh, which was my mom. The whole thing was arranged over the phone.  Even the wedding was done over the phone. Everyone was on the line: my grandparents, my uncles, the Islamic priest.  My parents didn’t even meet in person until five months after the wedding.  I’m the oldest child in our extended family. Plus I’m the first one to grow up in America, so everyone is watching me. I’m like the lab rat for the American Dream. I was initially told that I was going to be a doctor. One of my earliest memories is sitting in my SpongeBob chair, practicing my numbers and letters.  In first grade my parents hired my kindergarten teacher to tutor me after school. My mother would actually negotiate with my teachers during parent-teacher conferences.  When I didn’t have a perfect grade in 5th grade science, she convinced my teacher to let me build a baking soda volcano for extra credit.  We didn’t have food coloring so we used Bengali spices for the lava.  Right now I’m in my first year of college. My parents have let go of the doctor thing. I think they trust me now because they’ve seen me accomplish a lot of things. But I still feel a lot of pressure.  A lot of people are watching me back in Bangladesh.  The sense of family is so big there.  If one person gets lifted up, everyone gets lifted up.  So everyone wants me to do well. And I want to do well for them.
My mom got really famous around my junior year.  Up until then she’d been the director of a nonprofit in our community.  She’d organize little protests here and there.  But her profile really exploded after the election.  I remember sitting on the stage while she gave an important speech.  I could see blocks and blocks of people, all looking at her with admiration.  I knew things were about to change.  I knew she was going to get busier.  Now she’s always traveling.  She’s always giving interviews.  Sometimes she’s on the phone from 9 AM to 9 PM.  We’re so proud of her.  She’s finally doing what she’s always wanted to do.  But she tries to hide the dark side from us.  She tells us not to go on social media and read the comments, or the smears, or the death threats.  She thinks she’s shielding us from it, and we play along.  We pretend to only see the good stuff so she doesn’t have to worry about us feeling safe.  Her public persona comes into the house a lot.  She used to be a calm person with fiery moments.  Now she’s a fiery person with calm moments.  When she gets upset, she’ll go straight into speech mode.  I think she’s afraid to ever let it go.  I think the persona protects her from her own mind.  Her own doubts.  Her own fears.  She thinks she always has to be strong.  I think if she could just sit down and say ‘I’m scared,’ it would tear things down.  She could be Mom instead of an activist.
We dated for two years.  He looked great on paper.  He was a composer.  He was tall and handsome.  He convinced me that we were soul mates.  And he was big into grand gestures.  One time he rented a convertible, handed me a foldout map of Canada, and said: ‘Pick anywhere you want to go.’  He did keep cheating on me, but he’d blame that on his bipolar disorder.  He’d tell me that his high sex drive was a medical condition.  And I believed him.  Because I was young, and stupid, and in love.  For my twenty-fifth birthday we were going to take a vacation to Seattle.  He’d just gotten back from a two-week trip to Israel.  He was really quiet on the train ride to the airport.  And just as we’re arriving, he tells me that he met someone in Israel.  I start crying.  He’s stone faced.  I’m thinking if we can just get on the flight, everything will be fine.  We go all the way through security and get to the gate.  At this point I’m musical theater girl sobbing.  Our flight begins boarding.  Everyone is staring at us.  Eventually we’re the last two left, and the gate agents are waiting for us to make a decision.  So I decide we should go home.  But he insists that I let him buy me a ticket to Chicago, so I can spend my birthday with my family.  So that’s what I did.  And the next day he calls me to wish me a happy birthday, from Nashville.  He’d flown out that same night.  To visit the girl he met in Israel.  That was the last I spoke to him.  But he did email me a few years ago to tell me that he’d written a musical about his life.  The airport scene was included.  And he wanted me to attend the show.
When my wife first told me that she was pregnant, I couldn’t sit down.  I wanted to rearrange the furniture or something.  There was this urgency.  Like I should be doing more.  My daughter is eleven months old now, and the feeling hasn’t gone away.  Everything seems so consequential.  I’ve been thinking about everything from her point of view.  The memories she’ll have in the future are going to be based on the decisions I make now.  I especially worry about space.  We live in a tiny apartment, and she’s got this little 5x5 piece of carpet that she plays on. Today she walked for the first time, using her little pushcart thing.  But she can only walk four feet before she hits a wall and has to turn around.  And I don’t ever want her to feel limited or boxed in.  But we looked at new apartments recently, and everything we can afford is so small.  So I need to focus.  I need to learn more.  I need to get a promotion.  Because I don’t ever want her to have an awareness of being poor.  Or any kind of worry at all.  I just want everything to feel natural, so she can prioritize her own life and her own feelings.
Eighteen is when I started fully dressing up and doing make-up.  I came out to my girlfriend when I was twenty-one.  I told her ‘I think I might be trans.’  And she said: ‘I know already.  Because you’ve always looked at me the way a woman looks at another woman.’  She began to address me as my female name.  She’d come with me to the make-up counter so I wouldn’t feel awkward.  But I’d still only dress up at home.  I felt ashamed.  In public I did everything I could to suppress that side of me.  I’d wear baggy jeans and plaid shirts at work.  I grew a long beard.  I’d laugh at homophobic jokes.  But inside I felt like an absolute depressed shit.  I started keeping a private Instagram account where I followed people in the trans community, and one day I saw a post from a girl in Queens.  She was looking to make some trans friends in real life.  When I messaged her, she invited me to a party in New Jersey where a bunch of cross dressers rent out a bar.  I didn’t even consider it.  I didn’t know these people.  And I’d never even gone outside of the house before.  But she video chatted with me as her guy self, and talked me into joining.  The night of the party I was scared as fuck.  I’d laid out all my clothes: ripped skinny jeans, Johnny Cash T-shirt, red and black wig.  I had my make-up picked out.  But I didn’t think I could do it. I felt like I was going to throw up.  But I managed to walk downstairs and get into her car.  She was pumping me up the whole way there.  I smoked one last cigarette in the parking lot, and followed her into the party.  The first thing I heard someone say was: ‘Oh God.  She brought a real woman with her this time.’  I was over the moon.
I grew up on a farm in Florida.  It was almost like we lived in a time capsule.  Nothing but ass whoopings and hard work: raking the yard, feeding chickens, tending horses, planting fields.  And my family was Jehovah’s Witnesses.  So we had to follow the Bible.   We had to do every single thing.  There was no room for metaphors or interpretation.  It was almost cultish.  I only had two guilty pleasures: playing in the woods, and horror movies.  Once a month my older sister would take me to the mall.  She’d pretend I was her daughter and sneak me into horror movies.  I was only nine or ten years old but we saw them all: Poltergeist, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street.  She’d cover my eyes when there was a sex scene, which pissed me off, but everything else I saw.  I just loved seeing out-of-control maniacs on the screen.  My entire life had always been so controlled.  I loved the feeling of being afraid: everything runs through you, spine tingling, fight or flight.  It made me feel alive."
Solitude is necessary to balance things out.  But isolation is different. It doesn’t feel like a choice.  I don’t want people to see me. There’s this shame for not having much of a life.  Everyone else has full lives and families and jobs.  So I keep to myself.  It’s like there’s a big hole inside of me.  And a lot of air.  Some days it can be hard to move.  Recently I became really malnourished. One morning I woke up with an intense headache, and ended up having a seizure on the floor of my apartment.  I spent the next three months at a hospital in Brooklyn.  They let me take my wheelchair anywhere.  I could explore new floors and meet new people.  If anyone needed water, or books from the library— I’d get it for them.  My social worker told me that everyone liked having me there.  It was the strongest sense of community I’ve ever had.  I’ve been depressed since I got home.  I want to go back.
When the kids were young I was living in the moment.  I was just trying to get them through the day: homework projects, sleepovers, keeping the food coming.  Taking this one to a band concert.  That one to a track meet.  There were plenty of worries, but they always seemed manageable.  I could usually intervene if one of the kids had a problem.  And I thought: ‘Once they’re out of high school, I’m done.  I’ll finally be able to relax.’ But all my children are adults now, and I’m worrying more than ever.  Because their problems didn’t stop. They just became adult problems.  And there’s not much I can do anymore.  One of my sons has depression.  I began to notice during our Sunday night phone calls,  his voice was flat, the answers were short. Then I asked the right questions and it all came out.  He said:  ‘I’m depressed. And I don’t know why. And I don’t know how to fix it.’  One night he just wept on the phone, quiet weeping, which is the worst. Because there’s nothing to address. Just lots of dead space, and: ‘Are you still there?’  There wasn’t much I could say to cheer him up.  Mothers tend to lose their credibility after a lifetime of praise.  So I’m just left to worry if it will ever resolve.  I worry if he’ll ever be happy.  I urged him to see a professional, but there’s not much else I can do but pray.  I’m not sure if prayer helps, but I get on my knees and do it anyway.
I grew up in Colombia.  There wasn’t much to watch on television back then because we only had a few channels.  Everything was black-and-white.  But every night there was a famous music show.  All the big bands came on that show: the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin.  Always my nose would be stuck to the TV.  I went completely crazy.  My parents could not understand.  Sometimes I’d get so excited that I’d cry.  I grew my hair long.  I told myself: ‘One day I will be in a band.  I do not know how.  But I will do it.’  A few years later my father got the opportunity to manage a dairy farm in Spain.  From there I was able to get a visa to London.  I was nineteen years old, and London was almost too much for me.  It was so exciting.  All the time I was crying.  I worked as a dishwasher and started going to all the nightclubs.  I fell in love with punk music: Sid Vicious, Billy Idol, The Clash.  They made me dance like a crazy.  So many times I cried.  But I especially wanted to be on the stage.  So I found two guys and started a band.  We were called The Ridiculous.  For two months we played on the street outside the club.  But it was harder than I thought.  We never were invited inside.  Our drummer found another band.  Then the guitarist found another band.  And then it was just me.  That was forty years ago, but I’m still keeping the punk alive.  One day I will try again.
We’d been friends for three years.  We’d mostly see each other at the Catholic Center on campus: picnics, group outings, stuff like that.  But then we started hanging out alone.  And one day during finals week we spent an entire day together.  We talked for six hours straight, and that night we ended up eating burgers at Five Guys.  Remember it was finals week, so I was stressed out and sleep deprived and not thinking clearly.  I started telling him that he’s so great, and that I’ve never felt so comfortable with someone, and suddenly I realize that I’m practically telling him that I like him.  And he’s got this blank expression on his face.  Total poker face.  So I panicked, and said something silly.    She told me, word-for-word: ‘But don’t worry.  I could never date you.’  My heart sank.  I’d been planning on asking her out after finals.  I had a whole plan.  Suddenly it felt like I’d misread the last three years, and especially the last few months.  I tried to keep a straight face.  No crying.  And after we paid for the check, I dropped her off at the dorm and walked the entire two miles home.  I kept telling myself: ‘You can recover.  She’s still a dear friend.  Life has its ups and downs.’  Two weeks later I helped her move into a new apartment.  And we kept hanging out as friends for the next few months.  But then on Valentine’s Day, she sent me a neuroscience card.  It’s a bit of a tradition because we’re both neuroscience majors.  The card said: ‘Are you a neuron? Because you have action potential.’  Then she followed up with a text that said: ‘If a man really wants to impress me, he’d bring me pancakes and yellow roses.’  Suddenly things were looking up again.
Right now I just feel confused.  It’s fear, really.  I’m scared.  I’m graduating in a year.  I still don’t know what I want to do.  I’ve always wanted to be a leader in something.  But I don’t know what that is exactly, and I feel like if I’m not doing it already, then I’ll probably never be a leader in it.  So it’s a lot of stress.  The one thing that’s giving me solace is the thought of being a mom.  I’ve wanted to be a mother since the age of four.  I used to put blankets under my shirt to pretend like I was pregnant.  I love taking care of people.  And if I can’t conceive, I’ll adopt.  I’ve got everything figured out.  I didn’t think about it much in high school or middle school.  But now that the future is in such close proximity, motherhood has become my security blanket.  I think about it whenever I’m feeling overwhelmed.  Since everything seems to matter so much right now, it’s my way of saying: ‘nothing really matters.’  Because at least I’ll have a family.
I owned a frame shop in Atlanta for thirty years.  But every time I went to a theater and sat in the audience, I got the feeling that God had come and left without me.  I just knew that I was meant to perform.  Then one day a woman walked up to me in a health food store, and asked:  ‘Do you always talk like that or do you have a cold?’  I said: ‘Excuse me?’  And she told me that she wanted to cast me in a BMW commercial.  I thought it was a freebie.  But on the way out of the studio, they asked for my social security number.  $750 for three minutes on the mic!  I thought: ‘I need more of this.’  I started taking acting classes.  I got cast in a few local plays.  I moved to New York on my 50th birthday.  I wasn’t about to sit around in my later years wondering if my soul had gotten what it needs.  I drew unemployment for the first time in my life.  But by 2003 I was a member of SAG.  By 2005 I had a speaking part on Law and Order SVU.  And at the age of 62 I was given a full scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.  Things have dried up a bit since then.  I had to take care of my mother for six years.  And it’s hard for women of a certain age to get cast.  But it ain’t over yet.  Things happen when they’re supposed to happen.  And I’m a firm believer that nobody can get what is yours to have.  And I will tell you this: I’ve already envisioned what I’m wearing the first time I get invited to the Oscars.  Red mermaid dress, fitted from the waist to the knees, and flaring out at the bottom.  A stand-up collar that frames the back of my head.  Stunning neckline.  And a king’s ransom of rubies on loan from Harry Winston.
We had dorm rooms next to each other freshman year.  We mainly just played a lot of board games: Risk, Scrabble, Scattergories, a Trivial Pursuit game from the 1980’s, which everyone sucked at.  But we became best friends, and the next year decided to get a house together.  That’s when things started to get tense.  We began sitting closer together.  We were touching more.  We’d play with each other’s hands.  Never holding hands, but playing with hands.  And we’d even fall asleep in the same bed together.  There was a time that she told me goodnight, and I swear I felt her brush my lips, but by the time I opened my eyes she was out of the room.  Neither of us had ever dated a woman.  And I was terrified to try anything.  We were such good friends.  There was always this fear that if I voiced the desire, it would ruin our friendship.  But one night we were out for drinks at a hotel where Al Capone used to stay.  I was feeling pretty drunk, so I leaned over and said: ‘Sometimes I feel like I want to kiss you.’  And she replied: ‘Sometimes I do too.’  I didn’t say a thing.  I wasn’t even sure that I’d heard her correctly.  I just kept thinking: ‘Oh my God, it’s happening.  It’s happening.’  Then once we finished our drinks, and started walking home, I stopped her in front of a bridge.  I said: ‘Shall we do it here?’  It was December 12th, 2002.  And even though we got married five years ago, that’s the day we celebrate as our anniversary.

We worked in the same IT department.  I think our colleagues knew earlier than we did.  Whenever we’d go out, they kept trying to sit us next to each other.  She always seemed really interested in me.  She’d ask me a lot of questions.  But I felt really nervous because I’d never had a girlfriend before, and I didn’t want to mess it up.  So I kept things professional for about eight or nine months.  But then one night a group of us went to the club.  We were all having fun until a tall, blonde guy asked her to dance.  I had to think quickly.  I knew it was time to make a move.  Somehow I needed to separate them, but I didn’t want to escalate the situation.  This was a very tall man.  So I thought: ‘It’s time to dance.  You need to dance now.’  I wasn’t quite ready because I hadn’t had enough to drink.  But thankfully I’d just learned some dance moves from the movie Hitch.  Slowly I wedged myself between them.  I backed in,  butt first, using my special moves.  I didn’t even make eye contact with the guy.  Thankfully he gave up.  We danced together for about an hour.  At some point the rest of our colleagues went to the bar and left us all alone.  That’s when she leaned in and kissed me on the cheek.
Most teachers say I have messy handwriting but I’m just trying to write quickly so I can get it over with.  The assignments don’t make sense.  I’m not sure why our teacher is always saying ‘write about this’ or ‘write about that.’  If I decide to be an author, I’m not going to write about other people’s books or the play we just saw on a field trip.  I’m going to write about monsters.
I was going to Arizona State when my dad passed away.  I didn’t handle it well.  Sort of fell apart.  I had just paid $9,000 for the fucking semester.  I opened my laptop, dropped the semester, opened up a new tab, bought a one-way ticket to New York, and threw myself a going-away party.  Once I got here, I started working in retail.  But on the side I was writing about Fashion Week for a blog called Style Cartel, shout out to Charlotte, Muslim like me.  And every time I went to these events, I’d introduce myself as a stylist.  I kept saying: ‘I style athletes and celebrities.’  I didn’t give a fuck.  Then suddenly I started getting clients for real: actors, NFL players, you name it.  Now I’m up to 42 clients.  Down to two days a week in retail.  Pure hustle.  No Miami mommy money.  Well I’m not going to lie.  I did have a sugar daddy first year,  billionaire, you’ve heard of him.  But never fucked him.  Anyway, the one thing I’ve always wanted to do is go back to school.  Cause I promised my dad.  Then one night I was watching Billions and there’s this psychologist who always keeps the men in check.  So I peeped the psychology degree at Hunter College, walked into the admissions office, and told the lady: ‘My transcripts are trash.  My dad died of cancer.  But I’m intelligent.  I need a second chance.’  The deadline had already passed, but she ended up doing me a solid.  She performed some sort of alchemy on my transcripts and came out with a 2.6 GPA.  That was enough to get me in the door.  I just finished up my second semester.  Now I’ve got a 3.5 GPA.  Plus the teachers love me cause I’m entertaining in class.
It was simple.  So easy to get.  I just typed my information into a website, and was immediately approved.  I thought: ‘Here I go, I’m doing it, this is going to be great.’  The loans seemed like an investment.  According to the law school brochure, which turned out to be lies, I’d be making six figures when I graduated.  I thought the payments would be manageable.  Just another bill.  Like the phone bill.  I first knew I was in trouble after I got my first job, and well over half my income went toward payments.  I kept falling behind, calling some agency, and working out patches and fixes.  That dynamic lasted for years.  It was incredibly stressful.  Things have slowly gotten better, but then again, the debts have gotten larger as well.  My husband has them too.  They keep us where we are.  We’d like to move.  We’d like to own a house.  We’d like to do things.  But we just can’t.  We’re not sure if we want to have children.  But I feel like the debt keeps us from having clarity.  We need to be in a secure place to make that choice.  But I also know that if I don’t decide, nature will make the choice for me.  It’s not all bad.  My husband is an adorable teddy bear.  I made great friends in law school.  I adopted an amazing dog.  And I do enjoy my job.  I just wish I could go back and tell myself: ‘Girl, that’s a lot more than you think it is.’
When the relationship failed, it felt like I had failed.  Being a good girlfriend had been so important to me, and I couldn’t succeed at the one thing I put all my energy into.  Admittedly I was a very codependent partner, which is something I’m working on. Even after we broke up, I still hung out with him all the time. He saw it as a casual thing, but I was still looking for the validation of being wanted. I felt so lost.  All of my life plans had been contingent on the relationship.  Finally I moved back to New York, which is where I grew up. At the time it seemed like giving up. I moved in with my parents. My confidence was low.  I didn’t think I’d be able to find a job.  I went through all the motions but I felt like I was faking it. There was a voice in my head telling me that I didn’t deserve any of the jobs I was applying for. But after months of searching, I just got hired last Friday.  I’m going to be a trauma therapist at a victims’ services agency. It’s exactly what I wanted to be doing with my degree. It feels like the start of something. And that’s exactly what I needed.  Before coming home, everything felt haunted and attached to him.  But up here, everything is completely mine: my job, my schedule, my surroundings.  Even coming to Grand Central is something I used to do as a kid, and I’m doing it now, and I’ll continue to do it.  It’s connected to my history.  And it’s a part of me.  And it has nothing to do with him.
We were moving downstate.  My wife and daughters went ahead and I stayed behind to pack up the house.  The accident happened on Mother’s Day, so I was already feeling guilty that I wasn’t with them.  Their car stopped at a drawbridge and they were rear-ended by a distracted driver.  Knocked them forty yards onto the bridge.  They’re lucky they didn’t end up in the water.  I thought it was just a fender bender.  My daughters were fine, and my wife sent me a selfie to show that she was OK.  But then the swelling came.  And the next day she was completely black and blue.  It was a traumatic brain injury.  She’s better now, but she still gets very tired.  Sometimes it can hurt for her to carry on long conversations.  She’s been unable to work.  The insurance companies have been fighting us.  So it’s been a tough couple years.  But recently I started a cider business with my friend Steve.  It was a huge risk.  I’d never done anything like it, and there was always so much to do: picking apples, labeling, bottling, capping.  Some of the apples we grew ourselves, but we’d also find these abandoned orchards with wild, craggy, arthritic trees.  We’d literally pick tons of apples, take them to this turn-of-the-century cider mill, and watch them get pressed into juice.  Then we’d bottle the cider once spring came around, and I’d drive into the city to sell at markets.  We’ve sold hundreds of cases.  The response has been unbelievable.  It’s the most fun I’ve ever had.  It’s exhilarating.  But then I think about my wife, and I get the blues again.  It’s like my mind is at war.  I get sad because I’m away from home so often.  There’s a lot of driving involved.  But my wife says she understands.  She says that it’s good for me.
I was in my fourth year of owning my own interior design business.  Things were beginning to click.  I was finally hitting that sweet spot where after so many years of putting myself out there, business was starting to come to me.  I don’t one hundred percent remember the wreck.  I just remember driving to work, being hit from the side, and ending up in oncoming traffic.  I still haven’t fully recovered.  I had headaches for months.  I was sensitive to light and noise.  I got tired easily.  Some days I couldn’t even get out of bed.  And my business began to suffer.  I was forced to turn down offers, and each time I did, it felt like the opportunity would never come again.  Everything I’d worked for seemed to be slipping away.  I got mad at myself for not recovering faster.  I tried to push through the pain.  One morning I decided I was going to write an article, and take my daughter to play dates, and be home in time to cook dinner.  By the end of the day my head was going crazy.  My body was no longer willing to keep up with my drive.  I’ve always been a ‘yes’ person: student council, president of clubs, always one more thing.  But that isn’t working for me right now.  I’ve had to learn that the pain isn’t a weakness.  It’s a real injury.  And it needs time.  My current mantra is ‘do what you can.’  My only goal is to become a healthy mother, wife, and friend.  Today I’m meeting a friend from New Jersey.  And we’re just going to chill.
I was the only black girl in my sorority.  I don’t even know why I rushed.  I think I was inspired by ‘Saved By The Bell: The College Years.’  I pictured sleepovers, and nail painting, and close friends that you could share secrets with.  I imagined that once you became a sister, these things would just materialize.  But it doesn’t really work like that.  My pledge name was Eeyore.  I didn’t talk much.  I didn’t smile.  I always assumed people were thinking negative things, about my weight, or my clothes, or my hair.  I joined the sorority to feel like part of a community, but I mainly just felt black.  One time my sisters tried to set me up with the one black guy at another fraternity.  And once I was wearing a French maid’s costume, and somebody asked if I was Aunt Jemima.  I couldn’t seem to make any close friends.  Nobody really included me in things, or opened up to me.  And I always attributed it to my race.  It’s what I always assumed.  But now I’m not so sure.  Maybe I could have been more social.  Maybe I could have made more of an effort.  People don’t automatically want to spend time with you, and I wasn’t the friendliest person.  So it’s hard to tell: what was race, and what was me.
My parents used to live on a farm in a rural area of Costa Rica, but there were no schools nearby.  So they moved us to the city.  They could only afford a small house made of wood.  I was the youngest of eight children, and we split three bedrooms between us.  All of us couldn’t even fit at the kitchen table, so we had to eat breakfast in shifts.  We shared everything: school supplies, books, bicycles.  One Christmas we got a single pair of roller-skates for eight kids.  Adolescence was the most difficult.  My mother would sew our clothes from the same piece of cloth.  And I started to want a little privacy, but instead we’re sharing perfume, and shampoo, and deodorant.  But all the sharing brought us closer.  Everyone helped each other.  We had no choice.  When the oldest kids began to work, they paid for the younger ones’ studies.  All of us eventually went to college and became professionals.  When my mother passed away, she asked me to keep everyone together.  We have a WhatsApp group where we chat everyday, even if just to say good morning and good night.  Or to discuss ways to help my Dad.  Here’s a picture of everyone at his 90th birthday.  He still lives in the same house we grew up in, but we added a second story.  There are four more rooms now.  But whenever we get together, we still have to take turns at the kitchen table.
My whole life was denial until the divorce.  I always had a script that I followed, probably handed down from my mother.  Always be cheerful.  Always have a smile or a joke.  Insist that everything is great, or will be better soon.  Be likable, which is different than lovable.  And parties, parties, parties, I was always the hostess.  Because the hostess never has to expose herself.  Always bringing other people together: ‘Let’s sit Margaret next to Susan because they both went through this or that.’ Never mind what I might have been through.  Or who I am.  Not that I’d know who I am.  Because that takes time.  And the hostess is too busy keeping things bubbly and effervescent.  When the party’s over, there’s only time to sleep.  And I don’t remember my dreams.  Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a dinner for eight this evening.
I’ve been dancing ever since I was a little girl.  But college seemed like the natural order of things, so I went to Michigan State and got my bachelor’s degree in education.  After that I taught for five years in Detroit public schools. I enjoyed teaching. But I always knew that I wanted to be dancing full time.  On the weekends I’d perform in off-Broadway shows and little showcases. I was also dancing for the Detroit Lions.  But they didn’t even let us dance on the field.  We had our own little section in the stands.  I had friends who’d skipped college and focused entirely on dancing.  Some of them got jobs with major artists, and I started seeing them on TV.  I wanted that life.  But I knew it would require leaving Detroit.  And I just wasn’t ready. But then came the Beyoncé Formation World Tour. June 14th, 2016. Ford Field. I was sitting just above ground level, stage right.  And there was this moment during the song ‘Freedom,’ where all the dancers were dancing in water, and it was so beautiful.  I just remember sitting down in my seat, and thinking: ‘I can do this.’ The following Monday I told my boss that I’d be moving to New York.  I’ve been here for almost a year now. I’m tutoring and teaching to pay the rent. I was hoping to have a manager or agent by now, but it’s so competitive.  I’ve been to auditions with 400 people competing for five slots.  And everyone is so talented that the distinctions become so small: your body type, what you wear, how you wear your hair.  Things can seem out of your control.  But I’ve had some success. I danced at the Ladies of Hip Hop Festival.  I’ve gotten to final callbacks for Lion King, Mean Girls, Cats, and Motown the Musical.  So I know I have the talent. I know that I’m close. It’s like a carrot dangling in front of me. This year my goal is to have one significant performance.  And my ultimate goal is to dance on a world tour.  With any major artist, especially Beyoncé.
It happened at 8 pm, Monday, May 12th, 2014.  I was driving home with my boyfriend. I noticed a car coming into our lane so I swerved into three trees.  I almost died and completely destroyed a vertebra. I slept in a hospital bed for three months. I had to learn to walk again.  Even today my back requires a lot of maintenance.  It’s like an engine without oil. It grinds. It flares up. I actually just finished getting X-rays because it’s been a bad week.  But I take a lot of pride in how independent I’ve become despite the disability. Much more so than before the injury. I finally left Long Island and moved to the city. I’ve taken my health into my own hands, which is huge for me.  I have doctor appointments every day this week, but in a good way. I’m being proactive about my health. I can’t do high impact exercises, but I’m weightlifting a lot. And I’m traveling. Next month I’m going to Sri Lanka and India.  The sixteen-hour plane ride is going to be brutal, but it’s important for me. I don’t want to have any barriers. A couple years ago I went on a five day trek in Patagonia.  It was completely off the grid.  Just me, my sister, and my map.  My mother was terrified. It was my first major travel since the accident. And there’s no satellite reception, so if you hurt yourself, you’re done. But I was determined. I didn’t want my sister to leave me behind.  So I exercised every day for six weeks. I bought some hiking sticks and supportive shoes.  I carried 60 lbs of supplies on my back. Each day we hiked eight miles. I brought five pieces of chocolate, one for each day we finished. At night I’d rest my back. The last day was the hardest. We covered sixteen miles and climbed the highest summit. I kept trying to talk myself out of it. I was stopping every 50 feet.  I told my sister to keep going, but she stayed with me. And we finally got to the top. It wasn’t very cinematic. There was so much fog you couldn’t see a thing. But it was a huge deal for me. And I got to eat my last piece of chocolate.
She was ‘The Grandma.’  She worked as the head nurse at St. James hospital.  She owned her own house.   I lived with her up until the sixth grade.  We’d have these long conversations every night.  And every morning she’d make a ball of coconut for me to bring to school.  She was the most consistent thing in my life.  Even after Mom got mixed up in drugs, Grandma paid to keep our phone on.  She paid to keep our lights on.  She checked my grades and sent me to after-school programs.  She even bought me my first computer.  It was made especially for me, big tower, lots of lights.  It kept me off the street for months.  Grandma was the only person who ever took me out of the state.  We went to theme parks.  We went to water parks.  Once she even took me to the Bahamas for four days.  Most of my friends had never even left the block.  I did get mixed up in the streets for a while.  Grandma was upset when I dropped out of high school, but she still did her best to keep me level.  She helped me get my GED.  She talked to me about nursing.  She supported me when I joined the military.  I never thought I’d be where I am today.  I’m working construction.  I recently joined the union.  Everything is because of her.  She's the only woman who's name I have tattooed on my body.
We’ve broken up four or five times already.  But lately things have been great, we’ve been talking on the phone every night.  And she’s the one who suggested I come visit her.  So I’m thinking, great, we’ll spend a few days together, hang out, maybe have a little physical connection.  I bought a ticket on the Greyhound.  The ride was eight hours.  I did get some sleep, I will say that.  And after I arrived, she allowed me to come over for like thirty minutes.  Her Jamaican stepfather wasn’t allowing more than that.  But I’m thinking: ‘No problem.  It’s just the first night.’  We agree to see a movie the next evening.  I show up at her house right on time, and out she comes with her sister!  What’s going on here?  I’m not dating her sister.  And I’ve got to pay for three tickets now?  Luckily I was smart and loaded up on Dunkin Donuts before the movie.  But her sister is ordering popcorn, soda, nachos.  And this is a Regal Cinema, so that’s a full $20 order. I played it cool.  Acted like it wasn’t a big deal.  And when the movie ended, we made plans to spend Saturday together.  But then she says: ‘As long as it doesn’t snow.’  And of course it snows.  Half an inch.  Didn’t even stick.  But she refused to come outside.  Didn’t want to ‘get sick.’  So I just went out drinking and passed out on the floor of my friend’s apartment.  My bus was supposed to leave this morning, but they cancelled it because of weather.  So I just sent her a text.  She’s off work today.  Maybe she'll hang out with me.
My life is not significantly different, but it feels like everyone else has changed around me. All my friends are progressing down that heteronormative life stage thing.  They’ve gotten married.  Or gotten a house.  Or had kids.  Whereas I’m more in this extended adolescence thing.  It’s really changed my social life.  I used to be able to rally a group of friends on an hour’s notice.  But now it’s like herding cats.  You really have to work to get on someone’s calendar.  Last month I had dinner with good friends of mine, they’re a married couple.  Great people.  We wanted to squeeze in a date before their twins were born.  My job was to keep their child entertained while they cooked dinner.  He’s like two.  Wonderful kid.  Very nice kid.  Only says a few words, but nice personality.  Likes to hug the cat.  Really cares about the cat.  He’s also really big into picking things up and dropping them on the floor.  He showed me his box of pencils, even gave one to me, which I thought was really nice.  Things were going great.  But then came the ‘tired’ thing.  During dinner there was a sudden change.  He started rubbing his eyes.  Lots of throwing.  Rice and vegetables began to fly across the table.  Then came the screaming.  Nobody signaled this was abnormal, so I attempted to plow forward with the conversation.  I’d find short breaks in the screaming to slip in a few words.  But it got louder and louder.  The parents were professionals.  Completely unfazed.  And I didn’t care.  I was leaving in an hour anyway.
Driving makes me anxious.  I’ve avoided it all my life.  Errands only.  And I certainly have never left Suffolk County.  It was never a problem until my son decided to have a fucking kid.  Ellie Rose is her name.  Absolute delight.  But she lives three hours away.  So me, Chucky Bologna, pronounced like the city, not the lunchmeat, at the age of sixty-five, has to drive on the Cross Bronx Expressway if I want to see my granddaughter.  It’s a nightmare.  I get nervous even thinking about it.  The first time I made the trip was right after the birth.  I studied the route beforehand.  Memorized all my exits.  I refuse to use GPS because I can’t handle the lady talking to me while I’m trying to drive.  My husband packed the car.  We put my dog Lyle in the front seat for emotional support.  But that backfired because he sensed my anxiety and started licking my hands.  My girlfriend Annette told me: ‘Chucky, you’ll be fine.  Just own the center lane.  Find the center and stay there.’  So that’s what I did.  That minivan was not changing lanes for any fucking reason.  Three straight hours.  Didn’t even stop to pee.  I lost eight pounds of water weight from all the sweating.  But I made it.  When I got there, I felt so victorious.  Empowered.  Like I could drive anywhere.  But I haven’t, of course.  Way too scary.
I was at an anthropology field school in Guatemala.  I was twenty-two.  And I was having a crisis.  I had no idea what I wanted to do after college.  I remember sitting at a café with my favorite professor, and he told me: ‘If you were my daughter, I’d tell you to go into law.  From there you can work on anything: healthcare, policy, human rights.’   So when I returned home, I began to study for the LSAT.  I spent four years getting my Master’s in International Law, with a concentration in human rights and environmental justice.  Then last year I moved to New York to pursue a job in my chosen field.  But that’s not exactly what happened.  I’ve arranged meetings with twenty-five different attorneys to ‘better understand the field.’  And I’m always hoping to say the right words to catch their attention.  It’s poor form to say: ‘I need a job.’   But at the end of every meeting, I always ask: ‘Do you know any opportunities that I should be pursuing?’  And the answer is always ‘no.’  I do have a job right now, and I work hard at it, but it’s mainly reviewing records and writing letters.  It’s not the path I wanted to be on.  And the longer you work in another field, the harder it can be to transition.  I’ve always wanted to make an impact.  Ruth Bader Ginsburg is my idol.  And I worked hard on this.  I studied my ass off, I was valedictorian, I got into a great school, and got great scholarship money.  I’ve had a job since I was sixteen.  I focused on two or three friends.  I didn’t date.  This was supposed to be my thing.  And now it’s not working out.  I’ll never be in my twenties again.  Or living in New York. But I’m having a hard time enjoying it because I’m so focused on this one path that’s not opening up.
My father was a different person when he came home from Vietnam.  He drank a lot.  He was never around.  So everything I learned about being a man, I learned from my grandfather, Daniel O’Connell Renehan.  He also grew up without parents.  When he was two years old, his mother died while cooking soup.  The cauldron fell on her.  So my grandfather spent his childhood in an orphanage.  He never went to school, but he educated himself.  He was a voracious reader.  Eventually he became the treasurer of a bank on Park Avenue.  He was in his late fifties when I was born.  But he treated me like his son.  We’d watch Notre Dame Football together.  We’d go on long walks.  We’d sit on an old covered swing for hours and he’d tell me stories about Irish kings.  I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for him.  My mother did her best, but she was always at work, and there were too many wrong roads to take.  So I’ve lived my life by his example.  Being a father has always been the most important thing to me.  I’ve got four kids of my own now.  All of them turned out great, and one of them is named Daniel.
I had three bottles of wine on election night.  I got in bed after Pennsylvania, and stayed there for a week.  I’d only get up to use the bathroom and get more wine.  I’d have left the country by now if it wasn’t for my elderly mother.  I’ve weaned myself off Xanax, but I haven’t recovered.  I still watch MSNBC all the time.  I’ll spend entire days on the couch.  I’ll wake up with Morning Joe and go to sleep with Brian Williams.  I’ll get on Twitter during the commercials and search for any hint that somebody’s going to be indicted.  I know way too much.  I know the name of every congressman.  I know their district.  I know what percentage of the vote they got.  Before 2016, I hadn’t purchased a book in twenty years.  Now I buy all the political ones.  The scarier the better.   I even got the Omarosa book.  Nobody else wanted to read it so I thought I’d take one for the team.  I went to DC for four different protests.  And a few weeks ago I drove down to Mexico to see for myself what was happening on the border.  I’m obsessed.  It’s not healthy.  Recently I was able to cut myself off from politics for about a week.  But then here comes Brett Kavanaugh and I’m back on the couch for three days.
We’d been married for four years.  We had two young daughters.  Everything seemed normal.  He never stayed out late.  He was a police officer, but he was always home on weekends.  And we had a robust sex life.  He was my best friend.  Sometimes we’d stay up all night talking, no TV, just talking.  Then one morning I tried printing something out on our office computer, and it just kept printing out the same page.  It was a picture of his naked body, combined with the profile page for a gay website.  He said it was nothing.  Only porn.  Then a few months later I found the same picture in the ‘unsent messages’ folder of our Outlook account.  He’d been trying to send it to a transgender woman named Gabby.  That’s when I went through his Internet history and found thousands of jpegs of transgender porn.  He denied being gay.  He said it was nothing but a porn addiction.  But then a few weeks later I was reviewing our credit card statement, and saw that he’d gotten tested for HIV.  The next day he brought me to church.  He sat me down with the pastor.  And he confessed that he’d been having sex with transgender prostitutes throughout our marriage.  We didn’t immediately divorce.  I tried to make it work for our daughters.  He tried going to a treatment center at Johns Hopkins.  But I felt like I was married to a stranger.  It drove me to the edge.  On Super Bowl Sunday of that year, I was sitting in my bed, crying, heavily medicated, when I heard him on the phone downstairs.  He was laughing like he didn’t have a care in the world.  That night I checked his phone, and saw that he’d been talking to Gabby.  He’d been texting her every day for months.  The last one said: ‘My wife is getting suspicious.’  That’s when I kicked him out of the house.  I haven’t spoken to him in years.  He does call my daughters a couple times per week.  I just tell them that things between Mommy and Daddy didn’t work out.  He seems to be doing fine.  He has a new family now.  And he’s a minister.
My dad brought me here at the age of seven. My mom stayed back in Jamaica, so it was just me and him. He was very strict. It was cultural, mostly. He’d served in the military back home.  So he controlled all areas of my life, school, sports, socializing. Nothing was ever enough for him: not the first place medals, not the honor roll, nothing.  He tried hard to break me down. He’d wake me up at 3 AM to go running. He’d make me kneel on the floor all night. And he’d never let me speak back. He intimidated me into silence. I left the house when I turned eighteen. I got a job as a pharmacy tech.  I got my own apartment, but I still lived nearby. One day I was driving to work, and I saw him walking to the bus stop.  So I pulled over and picked him up. The ride was only ten minutes. But there was a different energy. He actually talked to me. And he let me talk back. He told me things about his life. He talked about how stressed he felt.  Things got better after that day. I’d occasionally drop by the house. I introduced him to my girlfriend. He’d tell jokes and laugh. We were beginning to form a relationship. On the morning he died, I actually drove past the crime scene without realizing it.  My phone was turned off because it’s not allowed at work. When I finally turned it on, I had several missed calls from him. Each time he left a voicemail: ‘Alex, pick up,’ ‘Alex, please come get me,’ ‘Alex, I need a ride.’ The only time he didn’t leave a voicemail was the very last call. He’d been shot in the neck while walking to the bus stop. I always wonder if the last call was while he was bleeding out. The next few months were surreal. I felt like I was sleepwalking. And I felt responsible. He’d called me for a ride and I’d been right around the corner. I ended up quitting my job.  I went to a recruiter’s office. And I punished myself the same way he’d have done it: I joined the Marines.
Last I heard he was arrested for buying large amounts of cocaine.  My mom let me know.  She called me one day and said: ‘I don’t want you to find out by Googling your name.’  It wasn’t a huge surprise, actually.  It explained a lot of his behavior.  He promised to pay for our school, then didn’t.  He never wanted to pay child support.  He started calling less and less.  I haven’t heard from him in years.  But I have a really, really great stepdad.  I just call him Andrew.  My first memory of him was when I was ten years old.  I just thought he was a nice older guy at the New Year's Eve party.  But my mom got hammered, and the whole ride home, she kept saying: ‘Isn’t he so great?  Isn’t he so cute?’  Two years later he moved in with us.  He never tried to discipline me.  He’d leave that to my mom.  He always had the attitude of: ‘I’m not your father.’  But he was another adult in the house that I could rely on.  And I’d never had that before.  He’d cook meals for us.  And he’d really work hard on them.  And he’d drive me places.  I think 95% of my needs at the time were cooking and driving.  Even today, I could call him if I need a ride anywhere.  If he’s not able to do it himself, he’ll pay for a cab.  Or he’ll figure out another solution.  It’s the kind of attention that makes you feel like you’re deserving of someone else’s time.  He’s far from perfect.  He works too much.  He snores.  He doesn’t do his laundry.  But when I think of the qualities of a good man, or dad, or just person, Andrew’s got them.
I started selling when I was seventeen.  I didn’t even have to look for customers.  A bunch of my friends were squatting in an empty building near my house.  And they all smoked.  Plus they had people coming over all the time.  Everyone came to me.  It was the first real money I ever had.  I didn’t even know where to start spending.  I could buy real things: game consoles, clothes, all the stuff I’d never had before.  I got some $400 Jordan 9’s and only wore them twice.  The police don’t even care about it anymore.  An unmarked car stopped me while I was skating home last night.  They were searching for somebody who got in a fight.  When the detectives asked if I had weed on me, I told them ‘yes.’  And they weren’t even worried about it.  They let me go.  But I want to stop dealing soon.  I’m almost twenty-five.  I’ve got ten grand hidden under my bed.  But that doesn’t even seem like much money to me anymore.  I could make more, but I don’t want to start growing it.  I don’t want weight in my house.  And I don’t want to sell to people that aren’t my friends.  So there’s nowhere to go.  And I’ve wasted a lot of time.  The money made me complacent.  I’ve been dealing for six years, and I’ve got nothing on my resume.  All I did was work at Macy’s for two months during the holiday season.
I began using coke in high school, and I never really stopped.  But it was under control.  I’d use it maybe once a month.  I was successful.  I worked as a commercial real estate broker.  But at the age of 42 I started drinking again.  At first I was just entertaining clients, but I began to flood into bad habits.  I was attracted to the underbelly of the city.  One night a prostitute in Brooklyn offered me a hit of crack, and I accepted.  Immediately I began to use against my will.  That year a $250,000 bonus was dumped into my bank account.  I did manage to pay the bills for the house, but all the rest went to smoking.  I became a horrible employee.  My family thought I was going to work every day, but I spent all my time bouncing between hotels and crack houses in Brooklyn.  My teenage son would leave me voicemail after voicemail, begging me to come home.  It was an ugly, dark, scary place.  I hit rock bottom in 2013.  One night I was having an orgy with two girls and a dealer, and my heart seized up.  I just kept hitting the crack, hoping for a heart attack.  I went to rehab on Christmas Day that year.  I had a few relapses, but I’ve been clean for four years now.  Recently I was taking some clients to a restaurant in Brooklyn, and as soon as I got out of the car, I noticed a woman coming toward me.  It was the girl who’d gotten me started.  She looked like Rihanna when I met her.  But now she looked horrible.  Her body had shrunk down to nothing.  Instantly I told her: ‘T, I have no money.’  But she spent fifteen minutes begging me and offering sex.  I told her that I couldn’t help her.  I felt horrible, but I couldn’t risk my own recovery by getting involved.   I remember that when we used to smoke, she’d always say: ‘Someday I’ll get clean, someday.’  But she never had a chance.  At the end of every night I could drive away.  I could go back to my phony fucking life in suburbia.  I could disconnect.  And when I decided to get clean, my neighbors and friends from the good side of life circled the wagons to help me.  But she had nowhere to go.  She had no one to help.  She lived in the insanity.
I was only sixteen when I got pregnant.  I was so disappointed in myself.  I thought I’d end up like one of those pregnant teens on Maury.  I did finish high school, I will say that.  But afterwards I had no good options.  My family didn’t have money.  My son’s father wasn’t around.  It was on me to do something.  So I joined the Navy.  I was basically gone for the next six years.  I had to leave my son with my parents.  It was an extremely hard decision.  But anything I did was going to look bad, if I had stayed behind, I would have just been a bum ass ‘project girl’ with a kid.  I had to provide.  And I was still a kid myself, so I needed experience.  When I came home for good, my son was seven years old.  He lives with me now.  We’re working on it.  I’d love for him to be a ‘mama’s boy,’ but in a lot of ways he’s still closer to my parents.  He gives them random hugs and kisses.  I have to ask for mine.  So we’ve still got a ways to go.  But I used the GI Bill to get a bachelor's degree.  And I’ve got a job where I make real money.  I’m proud of myself.  I work in a place that I never could have imagined when I was sixteen.  I have ‘work friends.’  I spend my day with people who are motivated to be better, not just in work, but as people.  I’m doing well.  And considering how I started, that’s an amazing thing.
I had the idea for a book right after I graduated from law school.  It’s a series of novels about superhuman professional fighters, like what the UFC would look like in the Marvel Universe.  I’d love to create an entire world like Tolkien did for Lord of The Rings. But right now it’s mostly just notes on my phone and computer.  I’ve had goals in the past, but not like this. I’ve never sunk so many hours into something. It’s become a very core part of my identity.  It’s like an application that’s constantly running in the background of my mind. Everything I see, I apply to the story.  The bridge behind me reminds me of the entrance to the main stadium, which is a sculpted archway of past fighters climbing over each other.  The book gives me a reason to explore more.  I'm taking long walks.  I’m looking deeper at things.  And I’m especially paying closer attention to other people.  It’s the only way to create believable characters. I have to think hard about the lives of people I meet, and the circumstances that made them who they are. So even if nothing else comes of the book, it’s made me a better person. Just having the goal has forced me to grow.
Ever since I was twelve years old, my mom wanted to bring us to America.  She said we’d be able to reach our goals faster.  At first she came alone.  In Peru she had a nice government job, but here she mopped floors and washed cars.  It took forever to get our papers because she wanted to bring us over legally.  There were so many times she told me to get read, but then it fell through.  I started to think it would never happen.  But then one year ago she called me and said it was time.  I left my whole life behind.  That first winter was so depressing.  I had to break up with my boyfriend. I didn’t know anyone here.  My English was suck.  I had my own bedroom in Peru, but here I had to share a room with three people.  I spent so much time crying.  I watched a lot of anime.  Even my cat wouldn’t play with me because she’s not very friendly.  But finally in March I found a job at a restaurant, and things began to turn around.  My coworkers became like family.  My manager Alizee is the most amazing person I’ve ever met.  And the guys in the kitchen help me with my English.  There’s a gym nearby, and after work I’ve been taking jiu-jitsu classes.  It’s helped me a lot.  There’s one position called guard, and as long as you can keep your guard up, you’ll be alright.  I feel like I’m finally in control.  This morning I paid for a whole semester of classes.  Last year was about surviving.  But this year I have goals.  The first one is to get better at jiu-jitsu.
My kids are going to be shocked when they become adults and learn that I’ve basically been playing a character for their entire lives.  All day long I have to pretend like I care about everything.  I’m a laid back guy.  I could actually care less if they make their beds.  Or if they scratch the walls.  But my character has expectations.  He says what he means and he does what he says.  My character hates video games.  He barely allows them in the house.  And he’ll banish them immediately when rules are broken.  But I actually play Mario Kart all the time when they’re at school.  Last week my character got really upset.  He threatened to throw away candy if the kids didn’t stop wrestling.  When the wrestling continued, he was forced to follow through.  I really thought it was a safe move.  It’d been so long since Halloween.  I was sure there’d be nothing good left, maybe just some chalky wafer things.  But the kid was saving the best stuff for last.  It was brutal.  Full sized candy bars.  There were tears.  I didn’t want to do it, but my character had to keep his word.  Then later I fished them out of the trash and ate them all.
(3/3) I ended up getting a full scholarship to SUNY Farmingdale as part of an anti-poverty program.  And I tell everyone who will listen: ‘Without Farmingdale, none of this would have been possible.’  I’ve been able to do so much in my life.  I’ve loved it all.  And I’ve brought passion to everything I do.  After graduation, I organized a program so disadvantaged black kids could tour historically black colleges in the South.  In my twenties I ran a youth program to help get kids off the street.  In my thirties I ‘jocked’ for three different radio stations on Long Island.  Then I entered the corporate world, and worked as the Director of Human Resources for Black Enterprise Magazine, Sesame Street, and Madison Square Garden.  Recently I retired and I’m beginning a new career as a background actor.  I’m starting to get some traction.  I’ve been a clubgoer on ‘God Friended Me,’ a juror on ‘Bull,’ a diner on ‘Bull,’ and a Costa Rican underworld gangster on ‘Blacklist.’  In some of the roles I have to pretend like I’m talking.  And I know that one day soon a director is going to notice me and give me an actual line of dialogue.  Check out this courtroom scene from ‘Shades of Blue.’  That’s Jennifer Lopez right there.  And who’s that behind her?  That’s right.  It’s Leon.
(2/3) My mother brought me to New York City when I was twelve years old.  We lived in an area of Long Island called ‘five towns.’  The first four towns were economically mobile.  But my town was the service community for the other four towns.  Our parents were the maids and chauffeurs.  I got myself a newspaper route when I turned thirteen.  There was one older man on my route who’d always give me a big tip if I could tell him the news.  So every morning I’d read two newspapers.  And every night I’d listen to Frankie Crocker on the radio.  He was ‘The Black Disc Jockey’ in New York at the time.  Every night from 4 PM to 8 PM, he’d play ‘R and B’ on 1600 WWRL , and you were a punk if you missed it.  One night he announced a contest to choose an honorary DJ.  I wrote an amazing letter because I listened every day, and I ended up winning.  I was sixteen years old.  The prize was supposed to be fifteen minutes on the air, but Crocker was so impressed that he gave me forty-five.  Before signing off, he asked me what I planned to do after graduating high school.  I told him: ‘I’m going to be the next Frankie Crocker!’
(1/3) I grew up in segregated Suffolk, Virginia in the 1950’s.  My elementary school had two rooms, two black teachers, and six grades.  I could never go downtown and shop in the stores.  I could never go to the movies.  I could never swim in the local swimming pool.  But we never cared about that stuff because we had a creek behind our house, and we didn’t have money for movies anyway.  My mother never let us accept the fact that we were poor.  There were seven of us, but we always wore shoes, not sneakers.  Mom wasn’t exactly the ‘lovey-dovey’ type.  She never used a switch on us, but she loved to use an example.  Every action in our house had an equal and opposite reaction.  In 1964 the World’s Fair came to town, and my high school band was invited to give a concert for the governor.  My mother gave me money to take my uniform to the cleaners.  But I never did it.  And she never let me go to that concert.  Before she died I drove her to the hospital, and I told her: ‘I’m still mad at you for not letting me go to the World’s Fair.’  She didn’t answer me, but she had this gleam in her eye that said: ‘You learned your lesson.’  And she’s right.  Those examples made me the man I am today.  I’ve literally done everything I wanted to do as a kid.  I may not have been to the World’s Fair, but I’ve been to Ghana.  I’ve been to the Caribbean.  I’ve travelled all over the world.
I got a Degree In The Written Arts, which is the most pretentious way of saying ‘English’ that my school could think of.  Two internships later, I’m still working at a restaurant.  I finally had an actual job interview last week.  The website said ‘big marketing firm,’ but the whole office fit in a closet.  Then I found out the job was ‘commission only.’  So I’m beginning to doubt that there’s a palpable job market in The Written Arts.  And I’m going to be paying off this education for the next ten years.  I’m bracing for the worst.  I feel like somebody who just realized that global warming is actually a thing.  It doesn’t help that my entire apartment is falling apart.  Our fridge broke down last week and we lost $120 worth of food.  Now my roommates are mad at me because I fumbled the negotiation with our landlord.  And to top it all off, my toilet overflowed this morning, with absolutely nothing to deserve it.  I just called my Mom for advice.  She recommended that I take a walk.  I was hoping she’d tell me that the water would go back in the toilet.  Either literally or metaphorically.
My dad comes from a place called Morocco that even my friends don’t know about.  It takes a whole day to get there.  It’s a little country with a little amount of people and little buildings made of sand.  At night there are a lot of bugs.  The people are nice but you can’t understand what they’re saying.  And they’ll give you food that you don’t know about.  But if you go into a store that’s owned by one of your dad’s friends, sometimes you’ll get extra candy.
It happened so quickly.  I’d just quit my job at an after school program. I’d been unemployed for three days.  I was waiting for my train at the 125th Street Station, and I noticed so much animosity.  It didn’t feel like a sharing and caring kind of place.  So I said to myself: ‘I’m going to help change the pace.’  I went to visit my high school chorus teacher, Mr. Williams, and I told him: ‘I want to sing on 125th Street.’  He thought it was great idea.  He said that he’d done the same thing when he was my age.  Together we found a cheap amp and microphone, and I gave it a try.  My first day was a Tuesday.  I stood on the downtown platform.  I’d never sung in public before.  I was so nervous that I couldn’t find my voice.  I wasn’t exactly mute, but I wasn’t fully singing either.  Then an old lady came up to me.  I’m pretty sure she was an angel.  She told me: ‘Sing Whitney Houston.’  Then she stood there, and kept saying: ‘Louder, louder, louder,’ until I was singing full volume.  I made $60 that day.  And I got so much positive feedback.  Now I’m singing four days a week and making enough to provide for me and my daughter.  And I get so much love.  So much love.  So, so much love.
Ten years ago I started a company.  It wasn’t a unicorn or anything, but after a few years it was worth a couple million dollars.  And that was enough for me.  I never wanted to be Bill Gates.  All I wanted was financial security.  And I thought I had achieved it.  We had a deal on the table.  It seemed like a sure thing.  It got so far along that I was sketching out my retirement.  But at the last moment it blew apart, and we never recovered.  Last Friday I called a personal bankruptcy attorney.  I haven’t even told my wife yet.  I want her to know the truth, but I don’t want to freak her out.  The stress is fucking killing me.  And I just turned sixty, so I’m grappling with the notion that I might not be employable.  After being successful for my whole life, suddenly I’m a failure.  But I’m trying not to let the dark side take over.  I'm fighting off suicidal thoughts.  I’m measuring my success by how well I can keep my humanity in the midst of this trauma.  If I can maintain respect for other people, it helps me feel better about myself.  So I’m trying not to snap at anyone.  I’m trying not to be vicious with my wife.  If I can’t be a successful person right now, at least I can be a good person.  And that’s a form of success.
The first time I tried it was in junior year of college.  I bought it from some guy in the library.  I was in acting school, and there was so much pressure put on our senior year showcase.  The pill gave me so much energy.  I remember making a seven-page spreadsheet of all the agents in New York, including their address, specialty, and preferred method of contact.  Adderall gave me an ‘in’ to caring.    It’s so hard to be an actor in New York.  You have to want it so badly.  But I’d always struggled with depression and lack of motivation.  I thought I’d finally found the solution.  I just went to the psychiatrist and told them I needed a prescription.  It was so easy to get.  It went from every week, to every other day, to every day.  I built my life around it.  It got to the point where I’d never leave the house or coffee shop.  I wasn’t even getting real work done.  I was just doing random shit.  I’d write songs, tinker with my website, and send random messages to people I hardly knew.  I wasn’t sleeping.  I hardly ate.  And the moment I stopped taking the pill, I’d feel disgusting.  I was destroying my body.  But the thing about Adderall is,  if you don’t tell anyone, nobody really knows.  From the outside it just looks like you’re motivated and working hard.  But you’re horribly addicted.  You look like you.  But it’s not really you.
I grew up in Australia.  For the first twenty-three years of my life, I lived and worked and partied within the space of a mile.  I had no goals.  I went out every night of the week.  But then in 2007 I went to visit a friend in Japan.  It was my first time on a plane, and suddenly I became addicted to the feeling of seeing something new.  I’ve travelled to fifty-one countries over the past ten years.  From March to October I work as a bartender on a small Scottish island.  I don’t take days off.  And that allows me to save enough money for another six months of travel, as long as I book far in advance.  And stay in hostels.  And limit myself to two meals a day.  I always avoid the expensive attractions.  My favorite thing to do is sit in parks.  After this I’m headed to Niagara Falls.  Then it’s up to Alaska.  I’m not sure what the end goal is.  I don’t have a bucket list.  I don’t feel the need to see every country.  In the beginning I was running away from my partying.  But now I’m just addicted to the unfamiliar.  Most of my friends are starting families and settling into their careers.  And I don’t have any savings.  So there are definitely times when I question if it’s worth it, but never while I’m traveling. 
I’ve always wanted to be a dad early in life.  I want to be energetic and active and mobile.  I’d like my parents to experience being grandparents.  My dad was thirty-three when I was born, so that’s always been a bit of a benchmark.  And unfortunately it just passed by.  But it’s not something I have any control over. In every other area of life, I can make progress by putting in work.  I can practice.  I can gain new skills.  But the harder I pursue having a family, the further away it seems.  It’s difficult to enter a relationship with children in mind.  It complicates things.  You ask heavy questions a little earlier than you should.  So I just do my best to put it out of my mind.  I’m in town for an engagement party right now, and last night I crashed with an old college friend.  This morning I helped feed his baby son.  I was pretty good at it.  He’s a picky eater, so I had to pretend to take bites myself.  I had to make funny faces.  I had to ‘boop’ him on the nose with the spoon.  But I got him to eat his breakfast.  And I guess it was the novelty of feeding someone, but the whole experience just rekindled the notion of: ‘I want this for myself.’
My therapist told me that reading the news was causing my depression.  So I’ve managed to completely avoid it for the past five years.  I used to consume articles for four hours every day.  I’d always read the New York Times front to back, everything except the sports section.  But then the Times caused the Iraq war so I switched over to leftist websites.  I always thought it was my obligation as a responsible citizen to pay attention to bad news.  I guess I was looking for some sort of understanding.  If only I could learn enough, then maybe I could help organize something.  But all of it just sent me into utter despair.  I began to look at other people as brainwashed.  Every time I saw someone having kids, I’d get angry.  Don’t they realize how uninhabitable the planet is going to be?  Everyone thinks if we just make a few changes, we’ll be fine.  We won’t be fine.  The problem is systemic and there’s no movement capable of ending capitalism in time to save the planet.  But anyway, I’m trying not to obsess over this stuff anymore.
I’m trying to be an installation artist, but it can be tough to sell your work. I love fairytales because they juxtapose romance and beauty with people getting their feet cut off.  So my last piece was a three-tiered chandelier of hundreds of honey bears suspended by their necks with vice grips, and dripping honey onto a bed of poisonous flowers.
I’ve known most of my close friends since I was four or five.  We went to the same schools.  We’d go to the same summer camps together.  So for the first eighteen years of my life, I was never really forced to meet new people.  But last year I went to college in North Carolina, and it was the first time that I didn’t know anybody.  During orientation they had some sort of street fair so that you could meet new people.  I followed a bunch of guys from my dorm there.  I tried jumping into the conversation a few times, but it seemed like everyone was talking to each other more.  Eventually they peeled off, and I just walked up and down the street alone.  That pretty much set the tone for the rest of the semester.  It was the longest four months of my life.  It seemed like everyone was making friends except me.  Or they’d already formed groups and weren’t accepting new people.  I kept hearing other kids making plans after class, and it was a reminder that other people were making connections that I couldn’t.  I spent most of my free time alone in my room.  I’d sleep through entire weekends.  I felt like a broken social person.  Recently I transferred to a school closer to home, and it’s been much better.  There were a few familiar faces, which helped.  But I’ve also relearned how to make friends.  I’ve joined a few groups.  I’ve put myself out there more.  I’m being more consistent with people.  And I’m trying not to take it personally if someone says ‘no’ to an invitation.  I’ve met some new friends this year.  And I’ve realized that being social isn’t really something you are.  It’s something you have to practice.
Have you ever thought about how we’re living in a society designed to give us anything we want, but we’re essentially the same people who lived during tribal times?  We’re catering to the same base needs like warmth and sex and social gratification, but we’re doing so through unnatural means.  If you think about it, the scrolling mechanism on a phone is a bit like strolling through a forest.  We still come across unknown things.  But now the first judgment that comes to our mind is immediately reinforced.  We can say I like it, and we’ll be given more of the same.  Or we can say ‘I don’t like it,’ and the thing will go away forever.  That single mechanism ascribes permanence to our most basic instincts.  We’re never forced to ask: ‘Why do I like it?’  Or ‘Should I like it?’  We’re living in a world that always adapts to us, so we never have to adapt to the world.  I wonder how that affects us.  I also wonder why we like squirrels but hate rats.  Because they’re both rodents.
I just finished medical school.  Now I’m heading to residency, which is supposed to be even tougher.  I’ve been working sixteen-hour days.  Then I’m expected to study every night when I get home.  Some of my classmates only sleep three hours per night.  I tried that for a few months during my surgery rotation, but I ended up getting really depressed.  I felt completely depersonalized.  Everything seemed like a dream.  To make matters worse, a lot of the instructors are jerks.  I think they went through hell when they were students, so they feel like they should put us through hell.  On the first day of rotations, my attending physician told me: ‘I’m an asshole, but I’ll make you a better doctor.’  He made fun of me in front of other students.  He put me down in front of patients.  He’d threaten to kick me out every day.  I guess they’re trying to weed people out and make strong doctors.  But they’re just traumatizing people.  They’re making us apathetic.  I got into medicine because I really wanted to make a difference in people’s lives.  But after going through hell, I just don’t care anymore.
My high school wasn’t very challenging.  I never had to struggle.  I was 15th in the class.  Section leader in my marching band.  Top of this.  Top of that.  Where I grew up, not too many people go to college out of state.  So when I got accepted into West Point, I assumed that I’d continue to succeed.  But I finished my first semester with a 2.5 GPA.  Not only was I barely surviving, but I felt like I was trying as hard as I could.  I started thinking: ‘Am I dumb?  Can I even do this?’  My second semester I had a physics teacher named Major Bowen.  He was honest with me about my faults.  He told me that I needed to get more sleep.  And that I had poor time management skills.  But he also told me some nice stuff.  He said that I was a good student to have in class.  And that I was definitely smart enough to succeed.  It’s nice to hear that stuff when you’re surrounded by so many naturally talented people.  Major Bowen showed me ways to become more efficient.  I started using calendars.  I started studying in groups.  I began tutoring people in calculus, because teaching is the best way to really learn a subject.  Six weeks into the second semester I got my first test back, and it was an ‘A.’  It was a ’90,’ but it was an ‘A.’  It was like: ‘Oh, wow.  I can do this.’
The symptoms didn’t start until I was seventeen.  I was volunteering at a soup kitchen one day and I got such bad stomach pain that I had to sit down.  That’s when I learned about Crohn’s disease, which basically means that I have ulcerations in my intestine.  It’s pretty brutal.  Constant pain.  Sometimes I can’t get out of bed.  Other times I throw up blood.  Once I got so desperate that I tried to heal myself with a thirty-five day water fast.  It didn’t work, and by the end I was down to 95 lbs.  I’ve gone through a lot of depression because of the pain.  Honestly, if it wasn’t for my wife and kids, I might have ended it by now. It’s heartbreaking for my wife to see me go through it.  And it’s heartbreaking for me to put her through it.  I feel like I’m holding her back.  She’s so adventurous.  She loves dancing, and traveling, and going out, and exploring.  And I can’t do any of that.  We took a three-day trip to the mountains in Seattle and I spent the entire time in tears on the couch.  Same thing happened when we took the kids to Disneyland.  I just hate being the sick husband.  She has to pick up so much of the slack.  But we’ve been to marital counseling.  And I’ve told her all of this.  And she swears that she wouldn’t change a thing.  And that she loves me just how I am.  And that I’m not a burden.  I don’t know, man.  We’ve been through so much shit together.  I guess she just really loves me.
Every month in prison they had something called Inmate Council, where you get to meet with the prison administration and make suggestions.  I volunteered to be the representative for my housing unit.  And toward the end of the meeting, the warden asked if anyone had questions or concerns.  The NBA finals were going on at the time.  So I raised my hand and asked: ‘If the Cavs force a game seven, can we keep the TV on past lock up time?’  And she agreed.  She agreed in front of everyone.  So when game seven came around, all of us were excited.  We gathered around the TV in the dayroom to watch the game.  But right as the second quarter was starting, the television clicked off.  The CO came down and tried to kick everybody out.  I told her the warden gave us permission, but she said it didn’t matter. And that’s when things began to go downhill.  We refused to leave.  The CO went behind a protected gate and pulled the silent alarm.  We grabbed all the tables and chairs and stacked them up against the door.  We covered the floor in shampoo and water.  The security team came back with riot gear and huge cans of pepper spray, but we kept the door closed for over two hours.  When they finally got inside, they were slipping all over the place.  We just laid down on the floor and put our hands behind our back.  I was given thirty days in solitary confinement.  But I had to do the right thing.  Women are allowed to vote because some woman wanted to vote.  The Civil Rights Movement started because Rosa Parks didn’t want to get out of her seat. And next time there’s a game seven of the NBA Finals, I bet they’re going to leave the TV on in Building Six at Rikers Island.
All my early memories are of my mom being an alcoholic.  We lived in a pretty ghetto area.  There was never food in the house.  We stole electricity from the neighbors.  Things were so bad that my dad got custody of us when I was five, but it wasn’t much better with him.  He always chose his girlfriends over us.  We moved around a lot.  During this time my mom would send me drunk texts.  She’d call me a horrible daughter and accuse me of forsaking her.  My whole childhood was unstable.  And I always craved stability.  The more I saw the relationships that my parents had with other people, the more I wanted to be a part of it.  I moved back in with my mother last year.  I helped her pay the bills.  I made sure she had food on the table.  I woke her up in the morning to go for job interviews.  It was awful.  She was drunk all the time.  But I knew that she needed me, and that gave me some sort of purpose.  I don’t really know what I’m doing with my life.  Or who I am.  Or what I want to be.  But if someone is dependent on me, then at least it’s a reason to stick around.  All my relationships have been like that.  I’m drawn to people who are insecure.  Who need to be wanted.  And then I do things to make them feel alone so they rely on me even more.  And if they ever try to pull away, I use my feelings to make them feel guilty.  It’s pretty toxic behavior.  But I learned from the best.
I’m a singer and songwriter.  And a bartender.  And a babysitter.  On weekends I host dinner parties for $65 a plate.  And I make soap to sell online.  And candles.  And tea baths.  And hair conditioner. And shampoo.  Basically I’m broke.  And I need a vacation.  But I’m on the move.  And I’m not stopping until somebody writes me a check for some of my music.
There were moments we had hope.  At one point he took this trial drug that magically melted his cancer away.  But despite the emotional swings, he only ended up living for sixteen months—which was exactly the initial prognosis.  Our three kids are still in high school.  Everything is uncertain right now.  It’s like I’m twenty years old again but without the excitement.  The only way I’ve been able to cope is by not stopping.  I couldn’t control my husband’s death, but I can make sure my kids don’t suffer in any other part of their lives.  We still get together with friends.  We still plan things.  I bought us expensive Broadway tickets on Father’s Day.  And afterward we went to the horse track, which was his favorite thing to do.  The homework is still getting done.  College applications are getting filled out.  So I don’t have time for a meltdown.  People think I’m doing better.  But honestly, life doesn’t seem good anymore.  It’s all so unfair.  Everything just comes to a screeching halt and you weren’t done yet.  I wasn’t done having a husband.  My kids weren’t done having a Dad.  So nothing really excites me anymore.  But I’ll still decorate for Christmas.  And we’ll still go to Disney World in June.  Because I never want the kids to think that they’re not enough.  Not long after my husband’s death, my son saw me crying, and asked: ‘Aren’t we enough to make you happy?’  That broke my heart.  I decided that I’m never going to let them feel that way again.


I’ve wanted to go into construction since high school. I used to help my dad out all the time. Everything in our house we built ourselves. But my teachers tried to steer me down a different path. They’d encourage me to ‘figure things out.’ They’d say: ‘Why don’t you do this?’ or ‘Why don’t you do that?’ But I chose construction because it’s what I like to do. I got my union card at eighteen. The pay isn’t bad. I get benefits. It feels good to be young and working every day. But I see all these advertisements on the subway, and they basically say: ‘If you want to be successful, you have to go to college.’ All my friends went to college. Some of them have liberal arts degrees that I didn’t even know existed. A couple more dropped out. The ones who graduated can’t find jobs and have a lot of student debt. But they still look at me like I’m on the wrong path. When I tell them I can help them get a job in construction, they always say the same thing: ‘Why would we want to do that?’


I lived in chaos for a long time, but I’ve been sober for thirty years.  And I’ve got a tremendous amount of gratitude for that.  Right now I have no money, no job, and no man.  But I’ve never been happier.  Because my only addictions are chocolate ice cream, feeling good, and gossip.


We normally spent time together on Sundays.  Because that was the only day he wasn’t drunk.  We’d watch football together.  I could name every player in the NFL.  Then he’d take me out to the backyard and have me throw footballs through a tire.  He wanted speed and accuracy.  He said he didn’t want me throwing like a girl.  He showed me how to use my hips to get extra power.  On weeknights he’d usually come home and pass out in the living room.  But if he’d been drinking hard liquor, he’d get angry.  That’s when I’d go up to my room and put on my headphones.  I’d listen to Alice Cooper or Black Sabbath and turn up the volume.  But I started to notice a pattern.  The yelling would get louder and louder until it suddenly stopped.  And that’s how I knew the beating had begun.  The next morning my mother would have bruises or fractures or missing teeth.  She’d always give me some lame excuse about falling down the stairs.  But I knew what was happening.  And for years I had this rage building inside of me.  Then one night, I finally took off my headphones.  I went downstairs and caught him in the act.  I ripped the phone off the kitchen wall and threw it as hard as I could at his head.  Right through the tire hole.  He woke up on the floor, called me a terrible daughter, and never touched my mother again.


Everyone is at war, except for me.  One uncle is fighting with the other.  My aunt’s not talking to Grandma.  Grandma isn’t talking to anyone.  She said that nobody’s coming to her house this year.  Christmas is cancelled.  I guess it’s always been like this.  But now everyone’s old enough that they don’t have to pretend for the kids anymore.  All of it’s out in the open.  I miss the ignorance of childhood.  When we’d all go to church, cook a big dinner, gather in a circle to read the Polar Express, and I wouldn’t notice that the adults were talking to the children more than each other. 
I was working as a prep cook at a BBQ joint in Harlem.  I got off work early one day, and I discovered my wife with another man.  That was the beginning of all this.  I’d been with her for twenty-one years.  I was devastated.  I got right back on the bus and headed back to the city.  I went straight to the bars on 42nd Street. I got wasted every day.  I lost my wallet, my phone, my contacts.  I didn’t want to do nothing.  I just said ‘F it.’  I’ve been out on the streets for eight months.  When it’s time to rest, I find a place to sleep.  But I spend most of my time here on this block.  These are the best people on this block.  I’ve never experienced so many good people in my life.  Some of them help me out every single day.  They say: ‘What are you doing out here?  We’ve never met anyone like you.’  Lily and her daughter brought the whole family to meet me on Thanksgiving.  I felt like a celebrity.  Then there’s Cheryl with the glasses who just walked by a couple minutes ago.  Love her.  John and his wife, love them too.  David and Michael are the best.  And what’s up to my man Sean from the beauty parlor.  Shout out to T and Marianne.  So many good friends on this block.  But they aren’t going to see me much longer because I found a program that’s going to give me a place to stay, and a job cleaning the streets.  I’m done with this life.  I don’t belong here.  And I know my grandkids miss Grandpa.  So if you don’t see me here soon, you can say: ‘He’s done it!  He’s gone!’  But I’m going to shock everybody.  Cause I’m coming back with Christmas cards.
Back in college they called me Mailbox Head.  Because my head was pretty big.  Mailbox Head was a little bit reckless.  I didn’t really have a plan in life back then.  I drank too much.  I threw illegal parties on campus.  I climbed abandoned bridges.  One time I broke my tailbone because I thought it’d be fun to make a toboggan out of a beer banner.  The wild behavior carried over into the first few years of my marriage.  But when I was 27, my daughter was born.  Three months later I went hiking with my buddies, and I started to climb a cliff without ropes.  And I got about eighty feet up, and I couldn’t get any higher.  But I also couldn’t get down.  I was so desperate that I was about to jump.  I kept thinking about my daughter.  Somehow my friend talked me down, and I ended up surviving.  But that was the end of Mailbox Head.
When my kid was twelve years old, I told him: ‘There are three things that are bullshit in this world: Santa Claus, professional wrestling, and politics.’  Yet people get so emotional about politics.  They’re always spouting sound bites from their favorite cable channel.  It’s so boring.  There’s no creativity.  Nothing but sound bites.  Then on Election Day, my newsfeed is filled with people posting smug pictures about how they voted.  Like it really matters.  In the end, the people with money are still going to be calling the shots.  Nothing matters.  But I guess it makes people feel like their life isn’t meaningless if they’re spouting off on Facebook.  I hardly ever post anything.  My profile picture is Uncle Sam and my cover image is an eagle shitting on him.
There was a permanent dark cloud in the house.  It was abuse in every way.  Mental.  Physical.  Sexual.  It was permanent fear.  Whenever my father was home, I just locked myself in my room and tried to be as quiet as possible.  My mother and I finally escaped when I was six, but the abuse stayed with me.  I didn’t make any friends at school.  I couldn’t trust anyone.  It was an open wound.  But when I was fourteen, my mom told me that we could do something about it.  She asked me if I’d be willing to testify.  And I agreed.  The trial happened two years later at my father’s military base.  I hadn’t seen him in ten years.  The lawyers told me I didn’t have to be in the courtroom when I testified, but I felt like I needed to face him.  Just to show that I wasn’t afraid anymore.  He was already seated when I walked in the room.  I put my hand on the Bible and looked right at him.  For a moment, I felt a stroke of fear wash over me.  Like I was a kid again.  But I set it aside and gave my testimony.  It felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders.  He was sentenced to ten years in prison.  I’ve moved on with my life.  I don’t think about him.  I’ve grown to look like him, but I’m not him.  Even if someone tells me I’m him, I’m not him.  I’m me.  I’ve lived my entire life to not be him.
It’s our anniversary today.  We always talk about how lucky we are to have found our person.  I wasn’t even supposed to go to the bar that night.  My friends and I were going to a golf tournament the next morning, so we wanted to get some sleep.  But at the last minute we decided to grab a quick drink.  My buddies were doing their thing, so I decided to take a lap around the bar.  And I noticed one girl that was just glowing.  I’m pretty sure that she was sitting right under one of the bar lights.  I just had to go for it.  I walked right up to her.  I said something like: ‘I want to take this opportunity to introduce myself to you.  After that I was grasping at straws.  I kept trying to find a common denominator.  But the best I could come up with was that she was in the same sorority as my friend’s cousin.  Somehow we ended up talking for the next fifteen minutes. The bar was so loud that we had to lean in to talk to each other.  At one point we actually touched cheeks.  And my buddies are gonna tear me apart for this, but I just remember thinking that she had the softest face.  I gave her my number at the end of the conversation.  I wasn’t really expecting to hear from her.  But the next day she told her mom the story, and her mom said: ‘Give him a call.  You don’t have to marry him.’


My dad does two jobs.  Sometimes he does fire fighter.  And sometimes he does police officer and fights crimes for the city by using smarts and helping people.  He says that the bad guys don’t always mean to steal, but they feel like they have to because their families are poor.  But if they sell drugs and make people sick then my dad will have to really arrest them for real.  I had an idea that one day I’m going to send notes to the bad guys and tell them not to do crimes anymore.  Then my dad can hand out the notes every time he fights a crime.  I'm going to say: ‘Dear bad guys, if you stop doing crimes, then you’ll have a better life and a better family.  And people will start to notice that you’re being a good guy and you’ll have a lot more friends.  And then everyone will help you and come visit you and you’ll start to feel really proud of yourself for being nice and having a nice family.’




We moved from Brazil three years ago.  We love Thanksgiving.  We cook everything.  But we’re still learning many things about the American culture.  Back home everyone likes to hug and kiss on the cheek.  It communicates that you care about someone.  But here it is different.  My friend tried to give me a Thanksgiving handshake at the gym today.  But I went in for a Thanksgiving hug.  And he only gave me a Thanksgiving half-hug.  A few months ago I was called into Human Resources, and they said: ‘Mr. Mauricio, no more hugging at the office.  It is making people uncomfortable.’  So I learned my lesson that day.  I came home and told the children: ‘Be careful not to touch your classmates.’




We’ve been boyfriend and girlfriend for just over two months.  We met at camp.  We didn’t talk to each other much at camp.  But then we decided to talk more after camp.  I go to boarding school, so this is the first time we’ve seen each other for five weeks.  But we talk a lot on the phone.  And we’ll help each other if we’re having a rough day.  This week I had an AP US History Exam.  I studied all the wrong stuff.  I thought there’d be a lot more questions on the War of 1812.  But instead there were a ton of questions about The American Revolution.  So I was pretty depressed. But she texted me and said: ‘You tried your best.  It’s all you can do.’  Then we talked about it all night until I went to bed.  And it just felt really nice to have somebody to make you feel better.




My wife urged me to take this little trip to New York so that I can clear my head.  It’s just for two days.  But my leash has been so short lately that it feels like an eternity.  Part of me definitely died when our daughter was born.  I was always a free spirited person.  I traveled a lot.  I never had a boss.  I had all the choices in the world.  But a lot of that disappeared in order to make things possible for my daughter.  I watch her during the day. And I’m not mad about it.  This is the happiest time of my life.  It would be great if my daughter was here right now.  It’d be so fun to watch her run around the park.  But I’d also be worried about her safety.  And the diaper bag.  And the car seat.  And the stroller.  And our next meal.  And our next place to stay.  There’s always a flickering flame of worry that doesn’t go away.  Back home we live by the beach.  And if my wife ever senses that I’m getting overwhelmed, she tells me to go jump in the ocean.  And that resets me for a few days.  It’s all I need.  I just need a little space to be me.  Because it can be so easy to get lost in helping a new person become someone.




I’ve got a stepson living with us at home.  He came over from the Ukraine when he was eighteen.  He was OK in the beginning.  I took him to some places.  We did some things.  But now he’s twenty-six.  And he’s still there.  His mom does everything for him.  She cooks, cleans, does his laundry, everything but wipe his butt.  He just stays in his room and reads his books.  It’s not that he’s a bad kid.  He doesn’t drink or do drugs.  But he’s just always there.  When I come home from work I want to relax.  I want to forget about my day.  I don’t want to listen to his loud voice.  And I don’t want him standing in the kitchen when I’m trying to cook.  I swear he steps in front of me on purpose.  And don’t even get me started on the bathroom.  This kid takes actual baths.   A normal guy takes a fucking shower, but not my stepson.  Hour long baths.




There was a program in San Francisco where they’d come into public schools and teach movement.  They’d look for kids with potential and give them scholarships to dance school.  They visited my school in third grade.  And I guess they saw something in me, because they provided two free ballet classes per week.  I didn’t really like it at first.  But one night I went to see The Nutcracker, and it inspired me to become a dancer.  I enrolled in a serious ballet school, and by the age of thirteen I was dancing five days a week.  Then six days a week.  The school started to get really competitive as we got older.  Everybody wanted to be a soloist.   Kids would come to the school from all over the world.  Some of them were ‘bunheads.’  All they did was dance and watch tapes.  But most of us were more balanced.  Ballet is extremely rigid, so if you have the opportunity to have fun, you take it.  I started drinking a lot.  And doing a lot of drugs.  It was hard to hide.  I’d come to class late and tired.  I ended up dropping out of regular high school.  The dance school never approved of that decision, but I always hated studying.  Personally I don’t think I ever lost my edge.  I was just driven in ballet and partying at the same time.  They kicked me out of the school when I turned twenty.  I knew it was coming, because that’s the age when you either go to college or join a dance company.  But neither of those were options for me, so I just quit completely.  That’s when the dancing stopped.  But the partying kept going.




Being six is so hard.  I have to go to school, and do math, and do a lot of words, and spell things, and take tests every Friday, and exercise, and play games that I don’t want to play.  And mom says we’re going to have another baby soon, so it’s going to be crazy.  We wanted a girl but we got a boy.  I don’t even know what I’m going to do.  I already have one brother who hits too much and goes everywhere without permission.




We’ve been together five years.  I wanted a marriage, a family, the whole thing.  But he wasn’t ready for a child.  So I think he was hoping I’d end the pregnancy.  He claims I took control of his life by keeping the baby.  He’s not the type of person to abandon his child, so he thinks I forced his hand.  At first it seemed like he was going to make the most of it.  He told all his friends about the pregnancy.  He took me out to eat.  We had a little vacation.  But that changed quickly.  There was no stomach rubbing.  No asking how I felt.  He started going out a lot, and stopped kissing me goodbye.  Our son is seventeen months now.  We still live under the same roof, but that’s about it.  There’s no physical intimacy.  Very little communication.  He’s always great with our son.  They play together and have a great time.  But there’s no ‘three of us.’  We never go anywhere together.  Or if we do, the conversation is awkward and surface level.  I try talking to him.  I tell him: ‘If you hate me or resent me, just let me know.’  But he says: ‘Quit forcing things.  Let it become what it’s going to be.’  But it’s been eighteen months and it hasn’t become anything.  He never wants to talk about our relationship.  I know that I should leave him, but I just don’t have the courage.  I keep hoping something will change.  Because I always wanted the experience of raising a child together.




He was the RA in my freshman dorm.  His nickname was ‘Rock.’  He was blonde and skinny and made legendary mix tapes for the dance parties.  We never talked much in college, but we became good friends when we reconnected at a reunion.  The event was eighties themed.  There were a lot of Talking Heads cover songs, and we danced all night.  After that we started talking every day.  Even though we live on different coasts, we’d find different ways to connect.  He’d create scavenger hunts for me.  He’d send me on missions to find obscure books and records.  And we began making mix tapes together.  Both of us come from research backgrounds, so we take our mix tapes very seriously.  MMTR is our acronym for the meaning of music: ‘Magic, Meditation, Therapy, Reunion.’  So there’s a lot of MMTR mix tapes: ‘MMTR I,’ ‘MMTR II,’ ‘MMTR III,’ ‘MMTR 80’s,’ ‘MMTR 90’s.’  Then there’s ‘Clan McJangle,’ which is nothing but Scottish Pop.  Then we’ve got another called ‘Buzz Gems,’ which is nothing but guitar songs under three minutes that alternate decades as you go down the playlist.  Our mix tapes hold us together.  Lately we’ve been working on a business together.  And if we ever get too frustrated, we just put on our headphones, choose a mix tape, and hit play at the exact same time.


I sold phone covers back in Ghana, but it wasn’t going anywhere.  So I came to South Africa to see if I could change my life.  I tried to switch over to the clothing business.  I knew how to sew, so I decided to give it a shot.  But things are even worse than before.  I can stand here all day and not get a single customer.  I’ve been at it for three years, and I don’t even know why I’m still making an effort.  I should have a wife by now.  And a house.  And kids.  But I have nothing.  How can I meet someone when I can’t even provide for myself?  Recently I fell in love with a woman.  She sells food around here.  We used to talk every day and night.  We bathed together, and slept together, and prayed together.  She’d give me smiles and kisses.  I didn’t have much, but I gave her what little I had.  For once I was finally happy.  Then she came over to my house one evening, and saw that I didn’t have anything.  No radio.  No television.  Nothing.  And she pretended like everything was OK.  She acted like it didn’t bother her.  But two weeks later she broke off contact.  She never said it was because I don’t have money.  But it’s because I don’t have money.  Sometimes I think I should just kill myself.  (Johannesburg, South Africa)




I used to work as a producer at a media company.  It was one of those cultures where you worked until you had nothing left to give.  My boss’s voice would be the first thing I heard every morning.  He’d phone me at 5 AM, asking ‘Have you done this?  Have you followed up with that?’  He’d put me down.  He’d shout at me during meetings.  I can tell you the exact type of tile in the office because I spent so much time looking down.  And I wasn’t allowed to grow.  I wasn’t allowed to do anything on the creative side.  I could only handle the budgets.   Once I asked him if I could leave early one day to take a course in art direction, and he said: ‘What makes you think you could succeed at something like that?’  That’s when I finally quit.  I freelanced for a while.  And the more distance I got from the job, the more I realized that I’d allowed myself to be pigeonholed.  I wanted to do something creative.  I started trying to save money to attend the New York Film Academy, but it was so expensive that I decided to put all that money into gear instead.  And for the past couple months, I’ve been making short documentaries about people.  I’ve made about twenty of them so far.  I let the person use the video however they’d like.  I’m not sure what will come of it, and I’ve only got a couple months of savings left, but for the first time in my life I feel like I’m using all of my talents.  And I’ve never had this much fun.(Johannesburg, South Africa)




My first job in film was as a trainee on a feature.  I think it was called ‘Gums and Noses.’  I cleaned the toilet, swept, made tea— things like that.  All I ever got was money for transportation, which was fine for me.  I just wanted to be on a film set.  But with two weeks left of filming, there was a bit of a disaster in the camera department.  A trainee blew up an HD monitor by plugging it into the wrong hole.  Which was a shame, but it was great for me because I always wanted to be a cinematographer.  When I heard them say they needed a replacement, I raised my hand and said: ‘Me, me, me!’  So that’s how it started.  And it never stopped.  The camera department can be a weird place.  It’s all white and male.  And it’s a bit like boot camp.  A lot of the guys are mean.  They don’t like being approached by subordinates.  And if you make a mistake, they’ll scream at you.  A lot of the guys act like they’re curing cancer instead of making beautiful pictures.  But I had thick skin.  So I moved up quickly.  Recently I DP’ed one of the most popular shows in South Africa.  And I run my department a little differently.  It’s much more chill.  I think we should all share our knowledge.  Nobody should be afraid to make mistakes or feel embarrassed to ask questions.  And one trainee should always be a girl.  It doesn’t matter if she’s studied or not, as long as she’s keen.(Johannesburg, South Africa)




I grew up thinking that it was a good thing to rob the white man.  Everyone fought injustice in their own way.  But in my neighborhood, we opposed the government by breaking into houses and robbing people.  But in 1994 we were told: ‘Democracy is coming.  Apartheid is ending.  It’s time to learn a trade.’  So I listened.  I did everything I was supposed to do.  I’ve worked in construction for the past twenty-five years.  I started my own company.  I followed all the procedures.  But nothing has come of it.  The government always talks about empowerment.  They make a big show of letting small businesses compete for contracts.  But the jobs always get awarded to the same few people.  If the government gave me work, it would empower me.  Then I could empower other people.  I could hire employees and teach them plumbing, and carpentry, and cabinets.  I could purchase a brick making machine, and hire women to mix cement.  But right now I can’t even afford a printer for my office.  Everything is hand to mouth.  I had high hopes when apartheid ended.  But I’ve been building houses for twenty-five years, and I’m still living in a shack.(Johannesburg, South Africa)




My dad moved us from Congo when I was a teenager.  I wasn’t given a choice in the matter.  I didn’t know anyone.  I couldn’t speak English.  And for a while I had an identity crisis.  I felt like my skin was too dark and my build was too muscular.  Other kids were telling me that I looked like a boy.  I got bullied a lot.  I didn’t have any friends.  I began to feel depressed.  Then one weekend I got invited to a party at a boy’s house.  I was excited to go.  But when I got there, it was nothing but drunk people.  Everyone was passing around a joint.  And when it got to me, the boy said: ‘Trust me, you’ll love it.’  So I tried it.  And I did love it.  Next thing you know, I was going out every weekend.  I started drinking heavily.  I was high all the time.  My grades began to drop.  But I was also getting cooler.  I was never alone anymore.  I was hanging out with popular people.  We all hyped each other up, so it was easy to ignore the consequences of our behavior.  But whenever I was alone again, I felt like I didn’t know myself anymore.  I was heading down the wrong path.  That’s not how I was brought up.  So I had to get conscious.  I had to be honest about what brings me happiness: writing poetry, reading books, and sometimes being alone.  I backed away from the party lifestyle.  I became more selfish with my time.  The other night I ran into a few of my old friends, and they were a little mad because I hadn’t been around.  They said I was acting like I was above it all.  But that’s not the case.  I’m just at a different stage of my life.(Johannesburg, South Africa)




I’m studying human rights.  It’s a long way off, but one day I’d like to be a lawyer and protect vulnerable populations in Africa.  My mother is African but I grew up in France.  In high school I went on a humanitarian mission to provide health and education for a village in Senegal.  There was no water.  There was no electricity.  We visited a small orphanage where the children had to beg for their food every day.  They had no choice, because if they came back with nothing, they didn’t eat.  I cried myself to sleep that night.  And when I returned to France, I felt guilty for everything: for living where I live, for having a family, for growing up in a rich country with education and healthcare.  I didn’t tell many people about my experience.  I didn’t want it to seem like a trophy.  And I was aware of the irony because France colonized Senegal.  But that trip opened my eyes to the opportunities I’d been taking for granted.  It made me appreciate the choices that I have in life.  And since those choices are a privilege, I want to use them to help other people.(Johannesburg, South Africa)


I started bodybuilding after my chemotherapy.  At first it was just a way to get healthy again.  But I discovered I was good at it.  I started winning competitions.  And I got hooked.  My boyfriend didn’t like it.  He thought it made me less desirable.  But the worse our relationship got, the more I focused on working out.  It just felt so great to be recognized for something.  I was really, really good at it.  And the bodybuilding community is so great.  They’re some of the least judgmental people because they’re used to being judged all the time.  For the first few years I was really self-conscious about my body.  But I’ve gotten to the point where the small comments don’t really bother me anymore: ‘ew,’ gross,’ ‘disgusting’, things like that.  I can usually block people out if they can’t type more than a sentence.   But occasionally the criticism sinks in.  It still hurts when people question my gender.  Or my sexuality.  And I’ve had some awkward Tinder dates.  The last guy said: ‘Holy fuck, you’re bigger than I thought you’d be.’  But despite all this, I’ve gotten comfortable in my own skin.  I actually feel more feminine now than I did growing up.  I was always skinny.  I never had breasts.  I didn’t ever feel like a natural woman.  But what is natural?  Is make-up natural?  Or botox?  Or fillers?  Or breast implants?  All of us are flawed.  My mask might be different than other people, but we all hide behind something.  I just hide behind my muscles.(Johannesburg, South Africa)




My dream is to create an incubator of sorts.  It can be difficult for start-ups to get funding in South Africa, so I’m trying to build a platform that connects investors and entrepreneurs.  I’ve been working on it full time for about a year now.  But the idea hasn’t taken off as quickly as I’d hoped.   Don’t get me wrong, I’m still on the grind.  I’m still having meetings and trying to put together deals.  I’m telling myself that no matter what, I’m going to figure this out.  But if I’m being absolutely honest with you, it’s not looking promising.  I’ve got about two or three months of runway left.  The bank has been calling me every day because of the credit card.  And my car just broke down, which will probably eat up twenty percent of my remaining reserves.  My options are running out.  It’s a lot of pressure, but I’m trying to focus on the bright side.  I made it a whole year.   We built the initial platform and had a few users.  And I’ve moved forward as a person.  I’ve gained a lot of new insights.  I’ve grown my network.  Experienced people have told me that I’m working on an important problem.  And that validation means more than money.  So even if this particular business fails, I’ll try again.  But next time I’ll come back at a better angle.(Johannesburg, South Africa)


The crime around here is out of control.  It’s not even safe to walk down the street.  People are snatching bags and phones in broad daylight.  And it’s even more dangerous when the sun goes down.  It’s bad for business.  Our customers are being scared away.  The police aren’t doing anything, so we’re forced to take matters into our own hands.  Recently one of my customers had his car broken into.  While I was repairing his shoe, we heard glass shatter.  And we saw three guys running away with his laptop computer.  I chased one of them down, caught him by the shirt, and began to beat him.  I made him call his brothers and tell them he was about to be killed.  Sure enough, they brought back the laptop.  So I let him go.  But the police came to my store the next day, and told me that I shouldn’t have taken matters into my own hands.  They said next time I’d go to jail.  But what am I supposed to do?  Let my customers be robbed?  Soon we won’t have any customers left.   If police aren’t willing to stop the crime, we must do it ourselves.  (Johannesburg, South Africa)




(2/2) Mom tried her best to pay for flight school, but we kept running out of money.  I’d have to drop out for a few weeks, and since flying involves so much muscle memory, it would take me a while to get back on track.  So one day I bought a stack of magazines and newspapers.  I went through every page and cut out the advertisements.  Then I opened my pantry and wrote down every brand I could find.  I sent all of them letters, asking for help.  Almost everyone said ‘no.’  But I did receive an amount from a grocery store called Pick-n-Pay.  And Breitling sent me a brand new watch to raffle.  That was a huge break.  I sold six hundred raffle tickets.  Things were going so well.  African Pilot Magazine promoted the raffle for free.  A man from Australia bought 100 tickets.  But then I got a letter from the Lottery Board ordering me to end my raffle.  They said it was illegal.  I tried to explain that I was raising money for my education, but they didn’t care.  I was so disappointed.  I’d have to sit out another year of flight school.  But when I called everyone to explain the situation, nobody would accept their money back.  They told me to keep it!  It was enough to keep me in the air for months.  Then around Christmas that year, one of my mentors invited me to eat lunch at the airport.  When I stepped out of the car, everyone who had ever helped me was there.  They all started clapping.  And somebody handed me the phone.  A person on the other end said: ‘You’re live on 94.7, and we’re going to pay for your entire education!’  That was nearly four years ago.  I just got my license last week.  My plan is to fly for South African Airlines, but first I want to do some teaching.  I want to visit schools in black neighborhoods.  I want all the kids to see what an African female pilot looks like. (Johannesburg, South Africa)




 In tenth grade we were given an assignment to shadow a professional in the workplace.  I wanted to be a doctor at the time, so I emailed some hospitals but never got a response.  Luckily one of my aunts worked in the back office of South African Airlines, so she invited me to come with her to the airport.  I’d never flown on an airplane before.  I remember looking out the window at all those big ass planes coming in to land.  My aunt could see that I wasn’t interested in the paperwork, so she took me to the crew room.  I noticed all the pilots had incredible posture.  All their hats were lined up on a shelf.  Their jackets were all hanging in a row.  And that’s when the bug bit me.  I started spending all my holidays there.  The pilots were very nice to me.  I don’t think they’d ever seen an African female who was so enthusiastic about becoming a pilot.  They gave me advice and let me share their simulator time.  When I turned eighteen, I visited a flight school and picked up an application.  But the costs were too much.  My mom said we didn’t have the money, and told me to apply to normal universities.  She’d bring me applications, but I kept hiding them under my bed and telling her I got rejected.  I found an internship with a glider company, and used my stipend to buy my first pilot’s uniform.  I put one stripe on the sleeve—for students.  When I came home that night, I think she took me seriously for the first time.  She could see her daughter really wanted to fly.               (Johannesburg, South Africa)




I hung out in the streets a lot as a child.  But when I was seventeen, my parents died in a minibus crash.  It forced me to wake up and work for myself.  I got my first job as a cleaner.  The boss ordered me around for months.  But when it was time to pay me, he refused.  It left me in a desperate situation.  I was hungry.  I needed shelter.  So I got frustrated.  Some of my friends were stealing cars at the time.  They had a special key that could open doors.  At first I didn’t want to get involved, but they were living the life I wanted.  They had nice cars.  They could afford to buy drinks.  So when they asked me to come along one night, I agreed.  I told myself: ‘If I just go along once, I’ll be alright.’  We stole three cars that night.  Everyone got away but me.  When I saw the police lights in my rearview mirror, I started crying immediately.  I knew my life was over.  I spent a few years in prison.  That’s where I met a social worker named Ms. Palesa.  She was near retirement.  And when she heard my story, she invited me to come work at her house when I got released.  I painted for her.  I cleaned.  I worked in the garden.  Not only did she pay me, but she treated me like her child.  She bought me clothes.  She encouraged me to learn a trade.  Ms. Palesa only lived for a few more years, but she set me on the right path.  Every friend that I stole cars with that night is either dead or in jail.  But I work every day, and I never committed another crime.    (Johannesburg, South Africa)




I carried the burden of doing well from very young in life.  My father died early, so things were never very stable growing up.  I lived in about ten different places.  So from an early age, I decided that I was going to change the narrative.  I’d use my gifts and talents to create stability for my family.  I did well in academics.  I took leadership positions in school.  And when I was thirteen years old, I set a goal of becoming the President of South Africa.  I always felt destined to achieve something great.  But most of all, I wanted to be an amazing mother.  For the longest time everything was going to plan.  But last year I got pregnant.  We were both just beginning our careers.  We’d only been dating for a few months.  So we decided that we’d try again when the time was right, and I ended the pregnancy.  That’s when things began to fall apart.  The relationship came to an end.  I went through a long stretch of unemployment.  After a lifetime of accomplishing my goals, everything stopped working.  And I just hadn’t prepared myself for the emotional trauma of the abortion.  I convinced myself that I’d made the wrong decision.  I’d spent my whole life planning to be this amazing mother, but when it finally happened, I couldn’t show up for it.  I fell into a dark place.  And I’ve been struggling with it ever since.  But there’s a verse in Jeremiah that God knows us in the womb.  And whether you live for a day, or a month, or if you’re never born at all—every life has a purpose.  So maybe there was a purpose for that life.  It interrupted me.  It interrupted all the achievements and goals and forced me to examine my truth.  I’ve accepted that mistakes happen.  Curveballs happen.  And that’s where deep learning occurs.  On the child’s due date, my best friend took me on a spa day, and she told me something that helped.  She said: ‘Every mother has an instinct.  And you were just doing what was best for your child.  Maybe the pregnancy wasn’t ended.  It was just delayed until you’re ready.’(Johannesburg, South Africa)




I’m trying to give Mom a chance to do other things.  She wants to wash her hair and cook dinner, but the baby started crying.  So I brought him outside to see if it would help.  We’ve gone about thirty minutes without screaming.  We’re from Mozambique.  I originally came here to find work as a ceiling installer, but I brought my wife along when we found out she was pregnant.  The healthcare is much better in this country.  It’s too early for them to go back home because the child was born premature, but I’ll feel safer when they’re gone.  It’s too dangerous for them here.  South Africa is a good place to work, but they don’t like us being here so much.  The abuse mainly comes from other black people. They call us names.  They tell us to go home.  They attack us because they think we’re stealing their jobs.  But I’m just doing what I know.  They don’t understand what it’s like in my country.  You can’t survive with kids.  I’m just making the only choice I have.(Johannesburg, South Africa)




My younger sister passed away last year from an unexpected stroke.  So I’m raising both my daughter and my niece.  In our culture, it’s an automatic.  It just kicks in.  She belongs to me now.  I’m a single mother so it’s not easy.  There are definitely months when I add up income and expenses and the numbers don’t work.  And both of them are thirteen so their moods are all over the place.  Today is like this, and tomorrow is like that.  But God has given us favor as well.  We can afford to share an ice cream.  We have shelter.  We have food.  And after four months of no work, I just found a new management position.  So we’ve come a long way.  My niece is beginning to heal.  Her grades are improving at school.  She still speaks of her mother in the present tense, but there’s no more crying at night.  And I’ve grown a lot as well.  Because more than I want to acknowledge, the struggle has given me meaning.  This is my purpose.  I have a little family.  And we share what little we have.(Johannesburg, South Africa)




I have nothing to complain about.  I’m originally from Sudan.  I love it there.  So many happy memories.  I got so much love from my family because I was the youngest.  Since then I’ve lived in five different countries and I’ve enjoyed every single one.  I don’t have a partner, but I have plenty of great friends.  I don’t have children, but I’m a lovely uncle.  I don’t take any medicine.  I sleep well.  I can walk around.  I don’t know what to say.  Every time I think about it, I conclude that I’m happy.  I wake up smiling.  I lived in Germany for several years.  And they have these cameras along the highway that photograph you when you’re speeding.  I’ve got a huge collection of photos because I love to speed.  It’s always just me alone in my car.  And I’m smiling in every one of them.(Johannesburg, South Africa)


(7/7)  While I was being interviewed on the radio, Carl Wilkens was attempting an impossible mission.  He’d gone to military headquarters, and begged the minister to let us transport children out of the orphanage.   He wanted to move them to a protected church near the UN Mission.  His request was denied because the children were Tutsi.  But then a miracle happened.  As he was leaving the building, the Prime Minister herself arrived for a meeting.  Carl ran up to her and began to plead for the children.  She told him to slow down and explain himself clearly.  Then not only did she grant him permission, but she offered two buses for the transportation.  Carl called me and told me to wait at the church.  He said he would bring the children to me.  I thought it was a suicide mission.  There were four hundred people hiding in the orphanage.  Many of them were malnourished and looked like fugitives.  It was clear they had been hiding out for months.  Why would the killers allow them to escape on buses?  But it was our only chance, so I came to the church and waited.  Carl told me the buses would arrive at 6 PM.  But there was no sign of them by 8 PM.  It had gotten completely dark.  I was losing hope.  But suddenly I heard people screaming: ‘Tutsis!  Tutsis!  Tutsis!’  The buses came around the curve, and pedestrians were chasing behind them.  Inside I could see five people piled into every seat.  The kids were hanging out the window, screaming: ‘Papa! Papa! Papa!’  Finally all of us were out of danger.  We sheltered in the church until the genocide was over, but it didn’t take long.  Three days later the capital was liberated.  And all of the children had survived.(Kigali, Rwanda)Nearly 5,000 people have donated to our fundraiser to help Damas as he continues to help underprivileged and traumatized children.  We just hit our goal.  Thanks so much everybody, Damas is thrilled.  Setting aside the dollar amount, it would be amazing if we could double the amount of donors.  From this point on, I’ll add an additional $1 from the HONY Patreon to every donation given.  Small amounts can have outsized impacts in developing countries.  So even if it’s only a few dollars, please consider being counted:




(6/7)  After people were discovered in the orphanage ceiling, the militia determined that I was a collaborator.  They held a high level meeting and passed a resolution to kill me.  I barely slept that night.  And the next morning I awoke to my name being called out over the radio.  It was the voice of the Minister of Social Affairs, and he was ordering me to report immediately to the radio station.  I was paralyzed with fear.  I didn’t know what to do.  Should I go there and be killed?  Or wait for them to come kill me?  I felt like locking myself away, but my brother forced me to make a decision.  So I decided to drive to the radio station.  The station director met me at the entrance, and informed me that I’d be doing a live interview on the radio.  It would be broadcast across the nation.  He sat me down in front of a microphone.  My mind was racing.  My hands were trembling, but I did my best to not sound nervous.  He started drilling me with questions.  He asked why there were so many rumors about the orphanage.  He asked if I was keeping any secrets.  He asked how many people I was hiding.  I steadied my voice.  I told him: ‘If I was hiding people, would I have come here to meet you?  I have nothing but children.  They’re just babies.’  He looked at me for a long time.  Then he finally spoke into his microphone: ‘Attention, militia!  Damas Gisimba is no longer a suspect.’(Kigali, Rwanda)




(5/7)  One night I was walking the property when I heard the children screaming.  They were saying, ‘Papa! Papa! Papa!’  The screams were coming from inside the office.  When I ran to see what was happening, I found that a group of killers had entered the building.  There were about fifteen of them.  They were wearing camouflage and carrying flashlights.  They had already begun to pull young men out of the ceiling.  I tried to stop them, but I was hit with the butt of a rifle.  The blow fractured my arm.  I didn’t dare to speak after that.  The killers were already angry.  If I annoyed them any more, they might harm the children.  Six young men were dragged into the kitchen.  They were beaten with pieces of wood that had nails sticking out.  The killers were screaming: ‘Where are the others?  Where are the others?’  At first the young men were begging for their lives, but their voices grew weak from loss of blood.  The children heard everything and kept trying to see what was happening.  I kept trying to chase them out of the room.  I yelled at them to go back to bed.  Eventually the young men were taken out to the bushes.  All night they were tortured.  I stood in the dark and listened to their voices.  We were hiding hundreds of people at that point.  I was sure they’d give everyone else away.  But they never spoke.  Their wives and family members were hiding in the ceiling, so they stayed silent until their deaths.  They saved all of us.  After the genocide, I built this memorial in their honor.        (Kigali, Rwanda)


(4/7) The militias would usually grow tired of killing people by 3 PM, and they would rest for the day.  That’s when I’d take people out of the ceiling to stretch their legs.  I’d circle the property.  I’d walk to a nearby pit where they threw dead bodies.  I’d listen closely to see if anyone was still alive, and I’d bring any survivors inside the orphanage.  During this time I lost all my emotions and feelings.  I became numb.  It seemed like any moment the militias would kill us, or a bomb would accidentally hit the orphanage.  And honestly I was ready for death.  It seemed like it would be the best thing for me.  My wife was also feeling hopeless.  We saw each other for just a few minutes every night.  She was busy trying to keep the babies alive.  She’d lost so much weight.  Her breast milk was gone.  And the children were barely alive.  They’d lost all of their muscle.  They were just skin and bones.  And we were almost out of food so I could no longer bribe the killers.  One day two men came in a truck asking for one of my employees by name.  They pretended that they had a child with them that needed medical treatment.  When she walked out to see the child, they pushed her into the truck and drove away.  Thankfully I was able to pull a baby out of her arms.  They killed her just a few meters from here, but it was too dangerous to recover her body until after the genocide.(Kigali, Rwanda)




(3/7)  Our most desperate problem was water.  The government had cut off our supply.  And we were packed so densely that the heat was unbearable.  Whenever we brought out jugs of water, one hundred liters would be consumed in less than a minute.  After two weeks we’d run out completely.  Then one morning I saw a car coming up the road.  It had the markings of the Adventist Church.  Out stepped a white man with a bulletproof vest.  His name was Carl Wilkens.  And he was the only American who had remained behind in Rwanda.  ‘I heard about you,’ he said.  ‘And I’ve come to encourage you.’  I took him around the property.  I showed him all the people I was hiding.  He could see that I was a nervous wreck.  So he began to pray with me.  He told me: ‘There is no way a man can survive this.  But God will help us through.’  I told Carl that we desperately needed water.  Without water we could not even cook our food.  So he promised me that he would try to help.  After that Carl would drive to the orphanage each week.  He’d bring water and milk for the kids.  And to this day, I don’t understand where he got it.  All of the stores were closed.  Carl was the only thing keeping us alive.  Every week I was convinced that he would be killed on the journey.  The roads were so dangerous.  People would shoot out his tires.  But every week he showed up with more water.(Kigali, Rwanda)




(2/7)  Over the next few days, the situation grew worse.  Bombs were being dropped all around us.  The streets had grown very loud.  The killers would chant and scream while they chased people.  All of the children were terrified.  We couldn’t hide the truth from them because they knew what was going on.  Some of the children who were arriving from the outside had witnessed their parents being killed.  Even the babies knew how to say: ‘Don’t kill me.  I’m not a Tutsi.’  The adolescent boys were especially vulnerable.  We hid them in the ceiling.  We had no fence around the orphanage back then, so there was nothing to protect us.  Just a line of trees.  Every day the militias would come looking for targets.  I'd meet them here at the entrance and try to bribe them with food.  I’d tell them: ‘I know your families are hungry.  Take this and go away.’  Luckily I had a shipping container full of porridge, corn, beans, and biscuits.  But word spread quickly.  The killers told each other: ‘If you tell Damas that you are going to kill his children, he will give you food.’  So more of them began to come.  And their demands grew larger.  So our food supply ran very low. And the people kept coming.  Eventually 400 people were being hidden in the orphanage.  We were like sardines in a can.  We had no food. No water.  No electricity.  No life.          (Kigali, Rwanda)




(1/7)  I inherited this orphanage from my father.  I was in my twenties at the time.  I had other dreams for my life, but the responsibility fell on me.  When my father passed away, he begged me: ‘Damas, please don’t abandon the children.’  So I promised him that I never would.  When the genocide began in 1994, I’d been managing the orphanage for several years.  I was thirty-three.  I was newly married.  I had a one-year-old child at home.  When I heard news of the president’s assassination, I immediately ran to comfort the children.  Gunfire had begun to enter the air.  We were housing about 65 children at the time.  Many of them were Tutsis.  I told the staff that nobody was allowed to leave the orphanage.  As the day passed, more and more people began arriving.  I had a reputation in the community for helping people.  So everyone came to me for shelter.  Their neighbors had turned against them.  Many of them were being chased by killers.  I knew that the penalty for sheltering Tutsis was death, but I didn’t have the heart to turn them away.  So I invited everyone inside.  I thought: ‘We have institutions in this country.  The United Nations is here.  The danger will be over soon.’(Kigali, Rwanda)




It might not seem possible for a nation to heal from genocide so quickly.  And some might think that our reconciliation is surface level.  But it runs deeper than that.  If we were truly a nation playing ‘make believe,’ our progress would have been impossible.  Rwanda’s per capita GDP has grown nearly 500% since the genocide.  And I understand that economics might seem like a dry subject, but you must consider what it represents.  It represents Rwandans working together.  And trading together.  And trusting each other.  It represents a consensus that our best future is a shared one.  Without true reconciliation, we’d have never come this far.  Do tribes still exist in Rwanda?  Of course.  There will always be divisions between us.  I can’t ask people to forget about these things.  But I tell them: ‘Consider the ways that we are a single tribe.  We all speak one language.  We all have the same culture, and dances, and behaviors.  So be proud of who you are.  But also be proud of being Rwandan.  Because that is something all of us are.(Kigali, Rwanda)




There was a huge puzzle after the genocide.  How do you pursue justice when the crime is so great?  You can’t lose one million people in one hundred days without an equal number of perpetrators.  But we also can’t imprison an entire nation.  So forgiveness was the only path forward. Survivors were asked to forgive and forget.  The death penalty was abolished.  We focused our justice on the organizers of the genocide.  Hundreds of thousands of perpetrators were rehabilitated and released back into their communities.  These decisions were agonizing.  I constantly questioned myself.  But each time I decided that Rwanda’s future was more important than justice.  It was a huge burden to place on the survivors.  And perhaps the burden was too great.  One day during a memorial service, I was approached by a survivor.  He was very emotional. ‘Why are you asking us to forgive?’ he asked me.  ‘Haven’t we suffered enough?  We weren’t the cause of this problem.  Why must we provide the solution?’  These were very challenging questions.  So I paused for a long time.  Then I told him: ‘I’m very sorry.  You are correct.  I am asking too much of you.  But I don’t know what to ask the perpetrators.  ‘Sorry’ won’t bring back any lives.  Only forgiveness can heal this nation.  The burden rests with the survivors because they are the only ones with something to give.’(Kigali, Rwanda)




(9/9)  This is a picture of my father before the genocide.  He’s surrounded by his Hutu friends.  They’re sharing beer.  They’re talking.  They always viewed him as a good person.  They’d even come to our home and flatter us.  They’d tell my sisters and me how good of children we were.  And that one day we’d marry their sons.  Many of these men would later help kill my family.  So how am I supposed to trust anyone?  Before the genocide, there were doctors taking care of their patients. Priests were taking care of their followers.  Neighbors were taking care of each other.  But none of that stopped them from killing each other.  And now we’re being asked to forgive.  Because our president tells us that reconciliation is the only path forward as a nation.  And I know that he’s right.  So I’m trying my best.  I’m spending time with Hutu people.  I even found two Hutu elders to mentor my son.  I want him to see that Hutus have good hearts.  My son even calls them ‘Grandpa.’  So I understand the need for reconciliation.  And I’m trying.  Christianity has helped me a great deal.  But true forgiveness is impossible.  My entire family was murdered.  How can I possibly forgive on behalf of those who can no longer speak for themselves?  It’s just not possible.  But I will certainly pretend.  Because I’ve seen where vengeance leads. (Butare, Rwanda)




(8/9) There were twelve people in my family before the genocide.  I’m the only one who survived.  We recovered eight of the bodies.  And we buried the bones we were able to find.  I didn’t trust anyone after the genocide.  Even when I was rescued by the Rwandan Patriotic Front, I wouldn’t take the food I was given.  I thought it might be poisoned.  So I’d eat raw food from the fields.  I was losing so much weight but I didn’t care.  People looked at me like I was a statue.  They assumed my emotions were frozen.  They knew my family was dead, and didn’t want to ask me questions.  So I held it all in for decades.  Who could I talk to anyway?  In a nation of one million victims, how do I begin to tell my story?  There’s been too much tragedy for everyone.  Some people lost their arms and legs.  Other people were raped and given HIV.  What makes my story worth telling?  Who am I?  Why should I ask for sympathy?  And who would I even ask?  So I never asked anyone.  I’ve never asked anyone for a thing.  I don’t want anyone to take care of me.  I don’t want people to celebrate my birthday.  Or cook for me.  Or tell me sweet words.  I’m fine with giving love.  But I can’t accept it.  Because I don’t want anything that can ever be taken away.(Butare, Rwanda)




(7/9)  I woke up to find that I’d been discovered by a soldier.  He dragged me to my feet and led me down the street to this alleyway.  He pointed his gun at me, and told me to say goodbye to my life.  At that point I felt ready to die.  But that’s when Mary came running out of her house.  She fell at the soldier’s feet and began pleading with him.  ‘Leave this girl for me,’ she said.  ‘You’ve killed her entire family.  Just leave this one for me.  God sent her to me.’  She offered the soldier all of her money.  She told him:  ‘When the war is over, you can come back and take this girl for a wife.’  And that’s what finally convinced him.  He handed me over.  Mary took me inside and cooked me food.  She gave me a change of clothes.  She tried to wash my hair, but it was too thick, so she cut it all off.  Then she hid me in the bushes behind her house.  I stayed there for weeks.  Every night Mary would bring me porridge and water.  She gave me a little radio so I could follow the news reports.  Each day the rebels were getting closer to our town.  Mary would encourage me.  She’d tell me that it would all be over soon.  And that I’d be rescued.  She promised me that I’d survive.  And Mary was right.  I did survive, because of her.(Butare, Rwanda)




(6/9)  The next morning, I heard people calling my name and I decided to show myself.  I was too exhausted to resist.  They told me there had been a general pardon for women and children.  And all of us who believed the rumor were taken to this place, the house of a Tutsi widow.  I found my mother and sisters when I arrived.  They were still alive, but were so weak and depressed that they could barely move.  We stayed in this house for two weeks.  There were sixteen of us here.  Then one night a soldier came and told us that we were scheduled to be executed.  My mother urged my younger sisters to run away, but none of them wanted to leave her side.  I begged Francine to escape with me.  She was the oldest.  We had a chance.  But she was too tired.  She’d been raped a few days earlier.  She told me she was ready for death.  Eighty soldiers came to the house that night.  They were carrying a list with our names.  They began grabbing people.  During the struggle, I jumped out the window and hid in a tree.  My mother was forty-eight years old.  Francine was sixteen.  Olivia was fourteen.  Noella was eleven.  Augtavienne was seven.  Claudette was four.  And Bebe was almost two.  I listened to their screams until I fainted.(Butare, Rwanda)


(5/9)  On the day I watched my father die, this is the skirt I was wearing.  I was only twenty-one years old.  I completely lost my will to live.  I walked down the street like a zombie.  I came to this house.  The owner wasn’t home at the time because she was busy looting my family’s home.  I tried to hide under her bed, but there was another Tutsi man there.  He began yelling at me to leave.  ‘It’s too small,’ he said.  ‘You’ll get us both killed.’  So I ran outside to jump in the toilet, but the killers were already at the door.  They dragged the man out from under the bed and killed him before my eyes.  They were about to kill me too, but the team leader said he had ‘other plans for me.’  And everyone listened to him because he had a gun.  He started leading me toward a plantation.  He told me to comply or he’d kill me.  He made me lie down on the ground.  He unbuttoned his shirt, lay down next to me, and tried to spread my legs.  So I grabbed his balls and squeezed as hard as I could.  He started trying to punch me.  So I squeezed them harder and twisted.  He kept writhing around but I didn’t let go until he fainted.  Then I began running through the dark.  I couldn’t see a thing.  I fell into a latrine full of shit, and I remained there all night because I was too tired to move. (Butare, Rwanda)




(4/9)  Our family was a top target because my father was so prominent.  So when the genocide officially commenced, the killing squads came straight to our home.  One of our neighbors peeled away from the group and ran ahead to warn us.  He came down our street, screaming at the top of his lungs:  ‘Run away!’ They are coming to kill you!’  My mother immediately dropped to her knees and started to pray.  My father yanked her off the ground.  He told us all to get out.  Everyone ran in different directions.  I don’t know why we split up, but there was gunfire and screaming all around.  I followed my mother and sisters to a nearby plantation.  The baby was with us.  We stayed there for four days.  But I didn’t feel comfortable.  All around I could hear people hunting for us.  They were calling our names.  We needed to find a new place.  I begged my mother and sisters to run away with me, but they were too depressed.  They didn’t have the energy to move.  So I went alone and returned to our house.  I was looking for our father.  I crouched down in a nearby bush and waited for him to return.  Early in the morning a crowd of people came marching over the hill.  My father was in the center.  He was so tall that I could see his face.  They marched him to this very spot, because he’d asked to be killed at his own home.  I could see everything from the bush.  I closed my eyes.  I said: ‘Please God, please change this man.  Please make it a different person.’  But when I opened my eyes—it was still his face.  I saw everything.  And the whole time I was trying to imagine it wasn’t him.  But when I opened my eyes, it was always him.  They finished him off with machetes.  When they finally left, I walked over to look at his body.  He was seconds away from death.  But he was still moving his head back and forth.       (Butare, Rwanda)




(3/9)  If you are being hunted, this bush is one of the best places to hide.  Every genocide survivor in Rwanda can tell you about this type of bush.  It’s full of thorns.  But if you crawl on your stomach, you can get inside.  And if you can get inside, you can finally take a rest.  The best hiding places are always the most dangerous ones.  Farms were no good.  Everyone who tried to hide on a farm was discovered.  Toilets were no good either.  Because that’s where they dumped the bodies.  You wanted to find a place where the killers were afraid to go.  The higher the risk, the less chance of getting caught.  Swamps were one of the most popular choices because there were so many ways to die in there.  It was easy to get stuck in the mud and drown.  Most of us couldn’t swim.  Or the mosquitos could give you malaria.  Or you could be killed by a single snakebite.  But the worst were the crocodiles.  I’d say fifty percent of the people who hid in the swamps were eaten by crocodiles.  My brother tried hiding in a swamp.  And he actually survived all these things.  He made it all the way to the border with Burundi.  But then a helicopter dropped fuel from above and set his swamp on fire.           (Butare, Rwanda)




(2/9)   When the presidential plane was shot down, people began to gossip about the impending genocide.  The streets were empty.  Nobody was travelling long distances.  We started to hear tales of violence.  Relatives from other regions would arrive on our doorstep with horror stories.  My father came home one day and told us about a Tutsi janitor at the university.  He cleaned clothes for the students.  That day he’d been tortured to death with his own iron.  I grew very depressed during this period.  I wanted to be alone all the time.  Some nights my family would sleep in a nearby church for safety, but I’d remain in the house alone.  I could feel something terrible in the air.  Then on April 21st, the genocide officially came to our town.  The militia gathered up Tutsi pedestrians in the city center.  They brought them to this stadium.  There were 200 people in all.  They put them in lines.  Then they opened the doors and invited the public to fill the seats.  The governor was forced to sit in the front row.  He had mixed blood and was against the genocide.  After the last person was executed, they brought the governor down and killed him too.  His body was paraded through the streets.  The killers were screaming into an intercom: ‘We’ve killed the governor!  Anything is possible!  Now let the hunt begin.’        (Butare, Rwanda)




(1/9)   My father was well respected in the community.  He was a university lecturer and a choir member.  But he was always working, so my mother was primarily the one who raised us.  Her name was Consolee.  She had this deep sorrow about her.  She was an orphan because her parents had been killed in the 1963 genocide.  Whenever we asked her to tell the story of our grandparents, she’d just say: ‘Give it time.  Soon you’ll see for yourself.’  I tried to help her as much as I could.  The eldest daughter acts like a mother in our culture, so I raised my six younger sisters.  They thought I was too strict.  They were always saying that I behaved like a nun.  But they looked up to me too.  And they loved me.  Occasionally I’d help to keep them out of trouble.  When my sister Francine cut her foot on a bottle, she was terrified to tell our mother because she wasn’t supposed to be barefoot.  I helped her conceal the crime by cutting a hole in the bottom of her shoe.  At night all my sisters would pile into my bed.  They’d beg me to tell them stories.  And I always did, until they fell asleep, and I’d carry them into their beds one by one.  The youngest was a boy.  He always took the longest because I had to rock him to sleep.  His name was Edmond Richard, but we called him ‘Bebe.’  He was was 1.5 years old when the genocide began.(Butare, Rwanda)




(6/6)  I was given the opportunity to visit Rwanda as part of my internship with the US Senate.  I was accompanying an important delegation.  But they must have thought I was crazy, because when we arrived in Rwanda, I began speaking to people in the streets.  I was convinced that everyone looked like me.  I wanted to find members of my family.  I wanted to see my old school.  I wanted to find my old house.  But all I could remember was the location of my grandmother’s house because it had been so close to the airport.  So that’s where we went.  We knocked on the door.  I didn’t reveal my identity.  When I asked the current resident if he knew about me, he told me that I had been killed.  But then he said that some of my family was still alive.  He told us that my sister was working at a nearby market.  So we decided to drive there.  The sun was going down.  At this point I was sure that I’d lost my mind.  Because we drove by a playground, and I saw a little boy that looked exactly like me.  I even took his photo.  I had no idea that he was my brother.  When we arrived at the market, it was almost completely dark.  But I saw my sister.  And she saw me.  She recognized me immediately because of the scar on my forehead.  Our brother had given me this scar when we were toddlers.  He didn’t survive the genocide.  When my sister saw me, we embraced.  We both started crying.  And she told me everything that happened while I was gone.  And I won’t share the details, because those aren’t my stories to tell.  But she gave me the biggest news of all.  I remember picking up the phone, and immediately calling Anne Peterson.  I told her: ‘Mom, you’re not going to believe this.  But I just found my mother.’(Kigali, Rwanda)———————————————–  If you are wondering why Nyanja is back in Rwanda, it’s because she has founded an organization called Little Hills, which aims to improve health services for children in Rwanda.  Her ultimate goal is to build a children’s hospital.  She’s created a small fundraiser, which I’ve kicked off with a $5,000 donation from the HONY Patreon.  If you’d like to empower Nyanja in the next phase of her life, and help improve healthcare for children in Rwanda, you may do so here:




(5/6)  During high school I got a lot of counseling.  I began to process what had happened to me.  I remember in tenth grade we had an English teacher who used to tell us to look in the mirror every morning and say: ‘I’m good and I’m beautiful.’  But I would always add: ‘And I’m extremely lucky.’  I’d look at myself closely and try to recognize my mother.  I started reading a lot of books.  One of them was called Anne of Green Gables, about an orphan girl who was different.  I decided that I was going to be like Anne and not let my bad luck ruin my life.  I went to college at Washington State.  I got an internship to work in the US Senate.  I even dreamed about one day becoming Secretary General of the United Nations.  But it was during this time that I also began to meet other people who’d escaped from Rwanda.  I listened to their stories.  And I began to realize the full context of what happened during the genocide.  I read about it obsessively.  I learned that the world had abandoned Rwanda.  The United Nations may have saved me, but they failed everyone else.  One million people were left to die.  At first I felt angry.  Then the anger turned into guilt.  Why had I survived?  For the longest time I didn’t even want to tell my story.  Because I didn’t want to give the United Nations any credit.  I didn’t want my story being used to put a positive spin on the situation.  I felt confused and conflicted.  But then at the age of twenty-one, I was given an opportunity to return to Rwanda.(Kigali, Rwanda)


(4/6)  After a year we were chosen for resettlement in the United States.  As soon as we arrived, I was separated from my grandmother.  She was put in a nursing home, and two months later she passed away.  It was the first time I’d cried since I left Rwanda.  She was all I had left.  I lived with my uncle for awhile but he was very abusive.  He treated me like a maid.  So I was removed from the home and put into foster care in Boise, Idaho.  But that was also a bad situation.  I was on the verge of running away.  And I’m pretty sure my social worker informed my school.   Because my art teacher started asking me about my plans.  Her name was Anne Peterson.  She was one of those teachers that you could talk to about anything.  So I answered all her questions.  I told her my story.  And I started bragging about my plan to take care of myself.  I think she decided: ‘Absolutely not.’  Because that’s when she chose to become my Mom.  Oh my God, it was amazing.  Ms. Peterson lived in a big, beautiful house.  I was the only child there.  I had my own room.  It was safe.  I didn’t have to worry about surviving.  Mom took care of everything.  She would wake me up to go to school every day.  She always made sure I had lunch.  She took me out to eat at restaurants.  It was amazing.  I was already fifteen years old.  But for the first time in years, I felt like a kid. (Kigali, Rwanda)


(3/6)  The plane took us to a refugee camp in Nairobi, Kenya.  It would be our home for the next year.  When I finally learned what was going on, I became one hundred percent convinced that my mother had been killed.  Other refugees were telling me stories.  Many of them had lost their entire families.  My uncle told me that everyone in our neighborhood had been captured, and he was almost positive that my mother was dead.  Surely if my mother was alive, she would have come for me.  My grandmother’s house was not far from our home.  So I accepted the truth.  But I didn’t have much time to think about it.  Because we had to fight for survival in the refugee camp.  My grandmother was paralyzed and couldn’t chew hard food.  So I’d spend my days trying to find her things to eat.  I’d negotiate with people for their eggs and bananas.  I spent the rest of my time by her side.  She couldn’t move so I had to keep the flies away.  But it wasn’t all bad.  I made friends with a few of the other kids in camp.  And I remember one time we stole money from the adults.  We snuck out of the camp and bought French fries from a roadside shop.  They were horrible quality.  They came in a little plastic bag.  But at the time I remember thinking they were the best thing I’d ever tasted.  (Kigali, Rwanda)




(2/6)  We stayed in the house for two nights.  On the third morning a neighbor warned us that the killing groups were coming our way, so we decided to leave without packing anything.  We were fortunate because my grandmother lived right next to the airport.  Her house backed right up to the airstrip, and it was one of the few places in the city still under the protection of the United Nations.  So my uncle cut a hole in the fence, and we began running toward some old trucks.  We couldn’t run very fast because we were pushing my grandmother in her wheelchair.  On the way I lost one of my yellow flip-flops.  I remember thinking: ‘My mother is going to kill me when I see her again.’  So I tried to turn back, but the adults screamed at me to keep running.  Finally we reached one of the old trucks and climbed beneath it.  We stayed under that truck for a week.  The UN knew we were there, but they left us alone.  Occasionally I’d run out and ask the soldiers for food.  There was one soldier in particular who always gave me biscuits and sardines.  He felt sorry for me because I was so small.  And when the UN finally evacuated, he came and got us.  They put us in the back of a cargo plane with some containers.  Nobody explained anything to me.  I was cold.  I was hungry.  I was tired.  All I wanted to do was go home and see my mother. (Kigali, Rwanda)


(1/6)  I was only ten years old at the time so I don’t remember much.  Nobody explains things to you when you’re a child.  I was never told that I was different.  Or that some people wanted to kill us.  My mother basically raised me by herself, but it wasn’t an unhappy childhood.  I do remember feeling afraid sometimes.  I remember occasionally being kept home from school.  And I remember not being allowed to play freely in the streets.  But these things were never fully explained to me.  When the genocide began, I was visiting my grandmother.  It was a school holiday.  I’d made good grades that semester, so my mother had bought me a pair of yellow flip-flops as a reward.  I was obsessed with them.  I remember waking up that morning and realizing something strange was going on.  I could hear gunshots outside and people screaming.  My grandmother told me to stay inside the house.  She’d recently had a stroke and was confined to a wheelchair, so it was just me and her alone in the room.  Eventually I got bored and decided to sneak outside to see what was happening.  All the streets were empty except for young boys with machetes.  That’s when my uncle came over, and I overheard him telling one of the maids that it was extremely dangerous outside.  He said that all of us might be killed.(Kigali, Rwanda)


(3/3)  When I woke up, I found myself lying alongside a very deep pit.  It was full of bodies.  My stepfather was standing over me.  Somehow he had learned about the attack, and had come with his bodyguards to rescue me.  He picked me off the ground.  I was barely conscious.  When we returned home, my stepfather called the government to complain about what had happened.  But he was told to watch his back.  He was told that our family was no longer under protection.  My mother begged me stop helping people.  She told my bodyguards to not let me leave the house.  But by that time the Rwandan Patriotic Front was getting very close to our village.  The fighting grew very intense.  My family packed everything and fled toward the border with Congo.  Four of my sisters were killed on the journey.   I remained behind with the seventy people.  Our bodyguards were gone.  We were helpless.  We had no guns.  We just prayed the rebels would liberate us as soon as possible.  I knew the killing groups would be coming to my home, so I gathered all the remaining biscuits and water.  I took everyone to the house of someone who had already been murdered.  It seemed like the safest place to be.  I closed them inside and padlocked the door.  Then I finally ran off to reunite with my family.  I learned later that everyone in that house was rescued.  Only four of the seventy lost their lives.  And almost all of them are still alive today.  We remain friends.  We’re still neighbors.  They bring me gifts.  I see them in the streets almost every day, and whenever we meet, they show me their love.    (Kigali, Rwanda)




(2/3)  The killings were being encouraged by the national radio station.  Every day they would announce how many people had been killed.  They’d announce the location of the killings.  And they’d give thanks to those who were doing the killing.  One morning I was sitting in my bedroom, and I heard an announcement on the radio: ‘Everyone is being killed in Gatobotobo except for those under the protection of the Felix family.’  I knew then that we were in danger.  Not long after the announcement, the Minister of Internal Security came to our village for a meeting.  It took place on a hill overlooking our property.  He could see everything that was happening in our compound.  When he left the meeting, his convoy began driving toward our home.  The minister was riding in a truck full of armed soldiers.  When he passed by me in the street, the truck slammed on the brakes.  All my bodyguards ran away and I was left completely alone.  My neighbors began to gather around.  They were laughing and applauding and saying, ‘This is the guy who was stopping the killings.’  The minister walked over to me.  He pushed me on the ground and leaned over my body.  He was covered with sweat.  His eyes were wide.  There was dried spit on the edges of his lips.  He had the face of the devil.  He took off his belt and began beating me until I lost consciousness.(Kigali, Rwanda)


(1/3)  The genocide was an opportunity to get rich.  Murdering people was the quickest way to accumulate wealth.  We were given permission from the government to seize the property of anyone we killed.  We were told it was our god given right.  But I never felt the temptation.  My family owned a very big supermarket.  I had my own car.  When the killings began in 1994, I had a scholarship to study in Greece and I was just waiting to begin university.  My stepfather was Vice President of our region, so we had four bodyguards in the house.  These guys were highly trained with automatic weapons.  They became good friends of mine.  I’d take them to the bar every night.  I’d drive them around and buy them anything they wanted.  They were also good human beings.  One night over drinks we discussed the genocide, and all of us decided: ‘We’re going to put an end to this in our neighborhood.’  The next morning I woke up to my neighbor screaming.  I looked out the window and saw that he’d been surrounded by a mob with machetes, and was bleeding badly from the head.  I’d been friends with him since childhood.  So I sent my bodyguards to save him.  The machetes were no match for our guns.  Word spread quickly after that.  Tutsi families came to our compound seeking refuge.  I took long walks with my bodyguards every morning, looking for people to save.  We drove to surrounding farms and searched the fields for survivors.  At one point we had seventy people under our protection.  Nobody challenged us.  I was young and cocky.  I thought we were untouchable.(Kigali, Rwanda)




My father was a talented engineer.  He could fix any type of truck, and he used his income to help the poor.  Our neighbors’ school fees and hospital bills were always paid.  My mother would bring needy people to our table, and order us to give them the best portions of meat.  She’d explain that these people rarely had the chance to eat well.  Both my parents were very religious.  But they always taught us: ‘Humanity first.  Everything else comes after.’  When the genocide began, they invited our Tutsi neighbors to hide in our house.  There were seven of them.  Some lived under the beds.  Others lived in the cupboards.  I was a teenager back then and my job was to change the waste buckets.  It was a miserable existence, and it went on for months.  But we prayed with them.  We tried to give them hope.  We told them that God was in control.  At night we’d give them Muslim dress so they could go in the backyard and get fresh air.  Our neighbors suspected us because our curtains were always closed.  We never slept because we knew the penalty for hiding Tutsis was death.  But all seven people in our house survived.  Unfortunately my mother and father died a few years ago, so I must tell their story for them.  Their names were Mukamunosi Adha and Gasano Juma.  They saved seven lives.  And they valued love and humanity more than anything.  (Kigali, Rwanda)




(4/4)  I managed to escape that day, but things had grown desperate.  In the end there were two thousand of us trying to survive.  We’d begun to run out of food.  The militia was losing on the battlefield and began to grow frustrated.  Two days before our rescue, they came to the church for a final big attack.   They were going in every room.  They were finding everyone.  Some of the mothers were lying on mattresses over their sons, trying to hide them.  But it was no use.  I’d managed to climb into the ceiling.  I’d poked holes in the exterior wall so I could breathe.  Through those holes I could see everything that was happening outside.  They tied every boy up, two-by-two.  They brought them to this exact spot and began to beat them.  Their mothers were screaming and crying from inside the building.  One group of boys was pulled to the center.  These were my friends.  We played soccer together.  We studied together.  Sebajura.  Galindo.  Muyoboke. Jean Bosco, he was a believer.  They walked up to Jean Bosco and kicked him in the head.  They told him: ‘We know you are a friend of Masengo. Tell us where he is.’  And Jean Bosco knew.  He knew where I was.  He’d seen me climb into the ceiling.  But he didn’t say a word.  So they beat him harder.  They kept saying: ‘Tell us, tell us, tell us.’  But he kept silent.  He kept silent until his last breath.  And then they shot him.  Jean Bosco died because of me.  He died for me.  Seventy-two young men died that day.  The crowd screamed the entire time.  But that night when I finally climbed down from the ceiling, everyone was silent.  Nobody was saying a word.(Kigali, Rwanda)




  One morning the killers brought a list of names, and gathered everyone together.  They told us to sit on the floor.  They stepped through the crowd and began reading out the names.  My name was called out, but it was misspelled by one letter.  They kept shouting ‘Marengo’ instead of ‘Masengo.’  But I knew it was me they were looking for.  They told the crowd: ‘If you give up these people, we won’t come back to kill your sons and daughters.’  But nobody spoke.  The killers were examining one person at a time.  I sat with my head between my knees.  Back then I had the face of a girl, so I tried to cover myself with fabric.  Some of the killers were from my neighborhood.  I knew that when they got around to me, I would be recognized.  So I slipped out and ran toward a banana plantation.  One of them spotted me and alerted the others.  I jumped over a brick fence and dove into the tallest grasses I could find.  Soon I heard footsteps.  They were walking all around me.  I remember one of them saying: ‘Cockroaches are so mysterious.  How are they able to disappear?’  He got so frustrated that he hacked at a banana tree with his machete.  The leaves fell on my legs.  I was lying with my cheek on the dirt.  I remember the exact time because my watch was next to my face.  It was 12:22 PM.  I remember thinking: ‘This is the time I’m going to die.    (Kigali, Rwanda)


(2/4)  The conditions were tolerable at first.  We were eating twice a day.  We could take showers.  But people kept pouring into the church compound.  Eventually there were two thousand of us.  All the young men began sleeping in the ceiling.  Women and children slept on the floor.  Beds were given to the elderly.  All of the priests abandoned us except for one.  His name was Celestin Hakizimana, and he stayed with us until the very end.  Every day he’d put on his gown, and stand right here at the gate.  When the killers arrived, he would tell them: ‘We only have innocents here.  Go find the enemy on the battlefield.’  If they refused to leave, he would take them to the church office and bribe them with money.  Once the killers tried to lure him from the compound by saying his father was dead, and that he was needed at the funeral.  But he told them: ‘Please send my blessings.’  He wouldn’t abandon us.  If any survivors knew the location of their family, Father Celestin would do his best to find them. He would put on his gown and drive out into the world.  One night he came back bloodied and beaten.  He had been stopped at a roadblock, laid down in the road, and kicked in the street.  But the next day he put on his gown once more, and drove out into the world.  He couldn’t always keep the killers out.  Some days they’d come with lists of people to kill.  And there was nothing he could do. He’d do his best to fool them by creating a registry of fake names.  But then they would choose people randomly.  They’d drag out twenty people at a time and bring them to their death.  Nothing could be done.        (Kigali, Rwanda)


  When we heard the president had been killed, I ran into the street with my friends.  We wanted to see what was happening.  Immediately two men came running after us with guns.  They were pointing at us and screaming: ‘You killed the president!’  All of us ran in different directions.  I ducked into a neighbor’s house and climbed into the ceiling, but my shoes fell off and landed on the bed.  The men discovered my shoes and they climbed into the ceiling after me.  Luckily I squeezed into a place they could not fit.  But when they finally left, the owner of the house told me I had to find another place.  He told me that people were hiding at the church of St. Paul, and that I should go there.  I left at 3 AM.  I walked through the forest.  I could hear gunfire and screaming in the dark.  The church was less than a kilometer away but the journey took me two hours.  When I finally arrived, I discovered hundreds of other survivors.  We were housed in the building behind me.  Every hour more people would arrive.  Each time a newcomer came through the front door, we would rush to them for news.  I learned that my brothers had been killed.  They had run to a nearby church, but the pastor opened its doors to the killers.  Another person told me that my mother had been killed.  She’d taken refuge in a nuns’ compound.  She was randomly chosen for death and shot in the head at 10 AM.  She lived until 5 pm.  But by the time I heard this, I couldn’t even cry.  I was completely numb.  I was just waiting to die myself.(Kigali, Rwanda)


(3/3) The killers formed a search party the next morning.  They gathered at the top of the hill.  We could see them coming toward us, searching every house along the way, and pulling out more people to join the hunt.  The mob was growing very big.  I knew that the end was upon us.  But the fighting was very intense that day.  Rockets were flying over our head, and some of them began landing on the hill.  One landed so close to the search party that they scattered in different directions.  I pulled everyone out of the hiding place and moved them to the forest behind our house.  Every night I’d wait until the streets were empty, and I’d bring them food.  For two weeks it went on like this.  I rationed what little we had. I lost all my weight because I was too scared to eat.  My breasts completely disappeared.  I didn’t even feel like a woman anymore.  I’d nearly given up on life.  Every morning I’d pray for the day to finish.  And every night I’d pray for the morning to come.  My husband wanted us to escape.  The only reason we remained in Kigali was to feed those people.  And after three weeks the capital finally fell.  The Rwandan Patriotic Front was advancing, and the Hutu boarded busses to flee the city.  Even the people who were hiding told me to abandon them.  So I gave them each a final ration of food and escaped.  But all of the people hiding on this property were rescued.  And every single one of them is alive today.(Kigali, Rwanda)




(2/3)  It was too dangerous to hide the man in the house.  So I brought him to this small room in the back, which we sometimes rented to tenants.  I pushed him inside and locked the door.  When I was opening our shop the next morning, another man came running to me for help.  He was limping badly.  He was out of breath and drenched in sweat.  I recognized him as a prominent Tutsi businessman.  ‘Save my life!’ he screamed.  ‘They are chasing me!’  So I quickly pulled him to the back of the house and locked him in this same room.  A few minutes later the killers arrived.  They searched all over the main house, but never checked the back room.  Over the next few days, six more people came looking for help.  We hid them all.  But my neighbors had been spying on us.  They reported everything.  And one night the killers showed up with guns.  When they knocked on the door, my husband started shivering and couldn’t stand up.  I told him: ‘You’re the man of the house. You must stand firm and face them.’  But he couldn’t move.  So I went to the door myself.  The killers were standing there with a list of the people hiding in our house. ‘Where are these cockroaches?’ they said.  I tried to tell them that we had no cockroaches, but they pushed past me and started searching.  They beat my husband until he was unable to speak.  I offered them all the money we had, and only then did they stop.  But they told us that they’d be coming back during the daylight for a house-to-house search.(Kigali, Rwanda)


(1/3)  My husband and I were shopkeepers at the time of the genocide.  We sold groceries on one side of the shop, and on the other side we had a bar.  On the night the president’s plane was shot down, the place was full. Everyone was dancing and listening to music.  We heard a large explosion but didn’t think anything of it.  Everyone just went back to dancing.  But the next morning people began shopping frantically.  We were selling food in large quantities.  When we were down to the last 100 kilograms of potatoes, I decided not to sell anymore.  I could tell that danger was coming.  Nobody came to the bar that night.  The streets were empty and quiet.  People were either planning violence, or they were hiding.  We were one of the first cities to be liberated during the genocide.  So almost immediately there was fierce fighting throughout the city.  The killers knew they had to murder as quickly as possible.  They were herding groups of Tutsis onto bridges and shooting them all.  My husband and I had a reputation for being friendly with Tutsis, so we were suspected of being traitors.  Our neighbors began watching us closely.  We feared for our lives.  We had a lot of property, so we knew there was a big incentive to murder us.  When the first Tutsis came to us looking for shelter, we turned them away.  But one night I was walking near the house, and I heard a close friend calling to me from a tree.  He was dying of hunger.  It had been raining all day.  I said to myself: ‘The property isn’t worth it,’ and I invited him inside.  I didn’t even inform my husband.(Kigali, Rwanda)




(4/4)  The journey to the border took nearly four hours.  Our pace was very slow because there were so many kids in the group, and everyone was weak from hunger.  We had to avoid the main roads.  Thankfully I’d mapped out the route so I could find our path in the dark.  All of us were frightened.  Even if we heard an animal, everyone would jump.  When we arrived at the border, I pointed the group toward Burundi and headed back to camp.  I was confident that I’d avoided detection.  Several days passed without incident.  I even managed to run one more mission with a mother and child.  But somehow news leaked out.  And one night when I was returning from patrol, a Tutsi solider met me at the door of the barracks.  He was out of breath.  ‘You are already dead,’ he said. ‘They will torture you.’  I thought he was just being paranoid, but then I heard my name being called out on the radio.  Orders were given to shoot me on sight.  I left everything behind and began to run.  I hopped over the fence.  I didn’t stop running until I arrived at the border.  The next time anyone saw me, I was on television bearing witness to the crimes I had seen.(Kigali, Rwanda)


  Our base was only twenty kilometers from the border with Burundi.  After the first day of killings, I rode to the border on a bicycle, just to study the route.  I knew that I was taking a giant risk.   But I was a religious person.  I was a Christian before I was a soldier.  So for me, killing innocent people was more of a risk than trying to help them escape.  Many Tutsi families were part of my church community.  I had prayed with them many times.  So when one of them reached out for help, I could not refuse.  They told me their neighbors had just been murdered.  They feared they were next.  So I told them to gather in one place and meet me at midnight.  I snuck out of the camp.  I told my roommate to tell everyone I was sick on the toilet.  When I got to the meeting place, I was expecting to find one family, but there were twenty-three people waiting.  Many of them were too scared to come out of the bush.  They saw my uniform and thought I was leading them to their death.  But the mother of the family gathered everyone together for prayer.  She said: ‘Lord, we are frightened.  But we are going to trust our brother in Christ to take us to safety.’(Kigali, Rwanda)


(2/4)  There had always been permission to kill any Tutsis we discovered while on patrol.  But on April 6th our instructions became very clear: every Tutsi was to be found and killed.  It was even said over the radio.  Our first official order was to drive to a nearby city and open fire on unarmed civilians.  Most soldiers carried out the orders with glee.  The hatred had sunk into their core.  Let it be remembered that the killings were pursued with pride, passion, and determination. Soldiers fired indiscriminately at people walking down the road.  I pretended to participate, but I didn’t pull the trigger.  That night we returned to the camp and everyone swapped stories.  They bragged about how many people they’d killed.  It became a competition.  Soldiers would radio from other bases, and say: ‘We’ve killed so many already.  Why can’t you keep up?’  All of it was sickening.  I couldn’t eat for weeks.  But it was most traumatizing for the Tutsi soldiers in our army.  My roommate was a Tutsi.  He had to pretend like he was enjoying the murder of his friends and family.  He had to laugh along with the others to save his own life.  He could only remove his mask with me.  And he was the only one that I trusted with my plan.(Kigali, Rwanda)




  When I was twelve years old, they undressed a Tutsi girl in front of my entire school.  They wanted to see if her private parts were the same as other people.  She kept trying to cover herself with her hands while they pulled out her hairs one by one.  I can still hear the laughter.  Even with all the violence that came later, that was the most traumatic moment of my life.  It’s still the image I see when I’m trying to fall asleep.  The genocide didn’t begin until many years later, when I was twenty-five years old.  I was a soldier in the army.  I could tell the atmosphere was growing more and more tense.  Our commanders were openly using ethnic slurs.  There was talk of ‘wiping our enemies from this country.’  One night I was assigned to guard four Tutsi prisoners.  They’d been accused of making explosives but were clearly innocent civilians.  They’d been tortured.  Their wounds were rotten and stinking.  A major came to the cell at 1AM and ordered me to step aside. ‘These people need to be killed immediately,’ he said.  But I refused.  I told him those were not my instructions.  He pushed and screamed, but eventually he stormed off.  The prisoners were released a few days later, but someone followed them out and killed them.  It was a sign of things to come.(Kigali, Rwanda)




(4/4)  We didn’t lose a single person.  After hiding out for three weeks, we were rescued by the Rwandan Patriotic Front.  Everyone came running in from the fields.  All of us were cheering.  In the end, over three hundred people survived the genocide by hiding in this church.  I can’t remember all their faces.  Life has taken us to many different corners.  And some of them have left the country to begin new lives.  But many of them still call me father.  I’ve given away the bride in several different wedding ceremonies.  Occasionally people will randomly show up on my doorstep with drinks.  I’ll say to them: ‘You were with us in the church, weren’t you?’  And we’ll embrace.  When I look back, I believe the genocide could have been stopped if more pastors had taken a stand.  We were the ones with influence.  The killers belonged to our congregations.  And we could have held them back.  But instead we did nothing.  And every pastor had a different excuse.  Some said they didn’t know things would get so bad.  Some said they were too afraid.  And some said the government was too powerful to oppose.  But when you’re standing aside while people die, every excuse is a lame one.    (Kigali, Rwanda) 


 The next time the killers came, there were fifty of them.  All of them had guns or machetes.  They pushed straight past me and entered the pastor’s residence.  They began pulling people out of the ceiling.  They were kicking us and dragging us along the floor.  I knew this was the end.  I could see our death clearly.  Some people were shivering and wailing and screaming for mercy.  Others were completely silent.  They’d already lost so many loved ones and they were ready to die themselves.  We were dragged to this very spot and put in three lines.  We began to say our last prayers.  I scanned the mob of killers for recognizable faces.  Many of them were Christians.  Some were even from my congregation.  Every time I recognized a face, I called to him by name.  I said: ‘When I die, I am going to heaven.  Where will you go?’  Then I pointed to the next man, and asked him the same question.  Then the next.  Then the next.   Some of the killers grew nervous.  They began to argue amongst themselves.  Nobody wanted to be the first to kill.  Soon they were threatening to shoot each other.  And they began to leave, one by one, until all of them had run off.            (Kigali, Rwanda)


(2/4) We filled every hiding place with a person.  Some were in the ceiling.  Some were in the cupboards.  Some were under the floor.  There were even two people in this toilet.  That very first evening the militia came to my front gate.  Some were carrying guns.  Others were carrying machetes.  They’d been told that I was hiding people.  They demanded to come inside and search the property.  I stood in the doorway and told them that they’d have to kill me first.  ‘We’ll be back,’ they said. ‘And thanks for gathering the cockroaches into one place.  Because it will be easier to kill them here.’  Days passed by.  We were an abandoned, dying group.  Our food ran out quickly.  Thankfully some church members answered my call, and agreed to sneak us food after dark.  The nights were the worst.  We could hear gunfire and screaming in the surrounding hills.  Always we thought we were next.  Nobody was sleeping.  My wife and I lost so much weight.  All our friends abandoned us.  They pretended not to know us.  Only one pastor stood by our side.  He came to me one night and warned me that there was a plan to attack the church.  I told the news to my wife, and we both agreed that we were ready to die.(Kigali, Rwanda)




 First came the meetings.  They were openly advertised on community microphones.  Their stated purpose was to discuss ‘current issues,’ but everyone knew that killings were being organized.  These things were being openly discussed on the radio at the time.  I was always invited to these meetings, but I never attended.  I was a pastor.  I wanted no part in those discussions.  But when the killings finally commenced on April 7th, people came running to my church for sanctuary.  The first of them arrived early in the morning.  They were trembling and too scared to speak.  All they could say was: ‘Hide us, hide us.’  I told everyone to go inside the church.  I said: ‘If our God is true, we will be OK.’  Finally a young man arrived who was able to talk.  ‘They killed my parents,’ he said. ‘All of us are being hunted.’  I was also terrified but I tried not to show it.  I just kept bringing people inside the gate.  By the time the sun went down, there were over three hundred people hiding on this property.(Kigali, Rwanda)




On April 6th 1994, an airplane carrying the President of Rwanda was shot down over the capital city of Kigali, serving as a catalyst for genocide against the minority Tutsi population.  One million people were killed over the next 100 days. It was one of the most violent episodes in human history.  The stories from that time can be traumatizing to hear.  Living through them is nearly unimaginable.  But in the wake of this tragedy, an equally unlikely story has unfolded.  It is the story of Rwanda’s recovery and reconciliation.  Rwanda has become one of Africa’s model economies.  Its streets are clean and safe.  Over one million tourists visit each year.  If you walk through Kigali today, it’s difficult to imagine the events that occurred less than twenty-five years ago.  But the stories are still there.  And you can’t listen to them without being reminded of humanity’s capacity for violence and the fragility of peace.  During my week in Rwanda, I focused on the stories of people who took a moral stand during the genocide.  These are members of the Hutu majority who risked their lives to shield and protect Tutsis.  In Rwanda they are known as ‘The Rescuers.’  Over the next several days, I will be sharing their stories.




I thought it was a prank.  I was only twenty years old.  It was the first time we’d ever had sex.  We discussed ending the pregnancy but I begged her to consider keeping it.  Both of our families were supportive.  I promised that I would provide. And once we decided to keep the child, I started earning money however I could.  I learned to print t-shirts and do graphic design.  I sold my phone to buy a camera.  My mother even took out a loan to help me buy it.  There was no photography school in this country, so I had to learn everything myself.  I took so many pictures of my daughter growing up.  My mother would sit for lighting practice.  I watched YouTube videos.  I watched every single class on Creative Live.  Finally I got good enough that someone hired me to take pictures of their party.  Then I moved on to weddings and corporate events.  Now my dream is to become a documentary photographer.  There are so many stories to tell in this country, but very few outlets will publish them.  That hasn’t stopped me though.  I’ve photographed a slaughterhouse with horrible conditions.  I’ve interviewed World War II veterans across the country.  Last year I spent three days documenting a ‘women-only’ village in Kenya.  Nobody would publish the work so I paid for the trip with my savings.  My wife has been so supportive.  She helps me edit the photos.  One day I’m hoping to sell my stories to international media.  And if I’m able to establish myself, I’d like to begin my own photography school in Ghana.  (Accra, Ghana)




I wanted to be a billionaire by the age of thirty.  It was a literal goal.  I wanted to be the African version of Bill Gates or Warren Buffett.  My parents always told me to work hard, and the money will come.  It just seemed like the prize you got for checking all the boxes.  And I always checked the boxes.  I made straight A’s.  I went to Howard University.  I worked at Goldman Sachs after graduating.  The plan was to make money, build relationships, then return to Ghana and create some businesses.  But my first business took too long to get off the ground.  Then I got frustrated and poured all my savings into another business.  Both of them were self-sustaining for a while, but it’s been a struggle since then.  Right now I’m trying to raise more funds and it’s not going well.  And I’m a far reach from where I wanted to be.  My confidence is shaken.  I’m unsure of my next step.  And I’m approaching forty.  I’m trying to manage the disappointment by changing my perspective.  I try to remind myself that I have a beautiful wife and son.  I’ve employed people.  And I’ve had some great experiences.  I no longer feel the need to be a billionaire.  My new goal is to have a successful business that I can work at every day.  But in the back of my mind, I keep wondering: ‘Am I developing a more realistic perspective?  Or is this what quitting sounds like?’  (Accra, Ghana)




When I remember that December is coming, I get anxious.  We pay rent at the end of the year and we don’t have it.  We’re saving all we can but we’re only halfway there.  My husband sells kabobs but it’s not going well.  I’m selling bananas to help out.  My children are wearing torn school uniforms.  I can only afford books for some of them.  I prioritize by who will get in the least amount of trouble with their teachers.  The smallest one doesn’t have any books right now, because I need the oldest one to get high marks.  I don’t know what I’ll do if we get evicted.  But I bounce back.  I’m a happy person.  And all of the shopkeepers around here are my friends.  We keep each other distracted.  We play jokes on each other.  We make each other laugh.  And we share what we have.  Some of them are drivers, and if they drive out to the province, they’ll bring back food for me.  So life can be good.  Things are manageable.  And I’m fine as long as I stay busy.  I only withdraw when I remember the challenges I have.  (Accra, Ghana)




There’s no decorum in this country when it comes to childbirth.  Our society expects you to have children.  People start watching your stomach immediately after marriage.  Soon the questions begin from family, friends, and eventually complete strangers.  Thankfully I have a supportive partner, because we went through seven miscarriages and two stillbirths.  The pressure from family was unbearable.  I was made to drink potions.  I bathed in holy water.  At one point I was even stripped naked in front of people to be scanned in the spirit realm.  It doesn’t matter how much education you have.  You get to the point where you’ll try anything.  You don’t feel like a woman anymore.  After years of trying, we finally visited a special doctor who said: ‘There’s nothing wrong with you.  Go on holiday.  Enjoy life.’  We dismissed his opinion because we’d given up, but nine months later our son was born.  Today I have three children.  Because of my difficulties, I try to help women who are going through the same thing.  I run a little community called My Sister’s Keeper.  We offer free therapy and fertility counseling for women who are having trouble.  But mainly it’s a place to cool off.  To get a free spa treatment.  To feel like a woman.  And to think about anything but having a baby.(Accra, Ghana)


(3/3) It’s not easy being king.  I have to follow many of the old rituals.  I cannot be seen in public without an escort.  I must always eat alone.  And the power isn’t what it used to be.  We’re living in a different time.  We aren’t battling for territory anymore.  We aren’t petitioning the colonies.  The palace still rules on minor disputes, but mainly my power is indirect.  I advocate for my people when the national government is setting its agenda.  I enjoy the role.  I want to improve the lives of all my subjects.  I want them to have clean water.  I want them to have quality education.  But my main focus is development.  I want our kingdom to become a tourist hub.  The income would transform so many lives, and we have so much to offer.  We have a beautiful river.  We have a great history.  And we have some of the oldest artifacts in Ghana.  In 1680 the Dutch built a castle on our shores, and my people captured it.  It was the first time in history that a black man owned a castle.  We held it for several years.  Eventually we gave it back, on one condition: they had to let us keep the keys.(Akwamufie, Ghana)
(2/3)  After I was granted asylum, I moved in with some cousins in the Bronx.  My first job was washing dishes in the kitchen of an adult home.  I was paid $297 every two weeks.  But I noticed that the private nursing assistants were paid a lot more, so I enrolled in some classes and received my certification.  My first assignment was a quadriplegic named Hector.  I ended up staying with him for six years.  I fed him, changed his diapers, helped him go to the bathroom, everything.  I really loved him.  We went all over the place.  We drove to Chicago and California.  My shift was the overnight, so sometimes I’d drive him to the club and he’d go dancing in his wheelchair.  I’d stand right next to him the entire time.  During the day I took classes at Lehman College.  I majored in health services.  After my graduation, the whispers began once more.  Family members were urging me to come home and take my rightful position on the throne.  So I said ‘goodbye’ to Hector and moved back to Ghana.  I got a job in business until the last king passed away in 2011.  And this time when the elders called on me, I was ready. (Akwamufie, Ghana)




(1/3)  I’m the 29th King of the Akwamu Empire.  Three hundred years ago we ruled the entire southern part of Ghana.  The English described us as ‘bullies.’  The Danes described us as ‘thieves.’  Today I have 120 towns under my jurisdiction.  But I didn’t always want to be king.  I knew from a young age that it was a possibility.  I’m from the royal bloodline.  But I just hoped they’d choose someone else.  I was in college the first time they tried to coronate me.  I was studying accounting.  I heard a rumor that the king had passed away and that I would be next.  So I panicked.  I googled ‘political asylum.’  I took someone else’s passport.  I didn’t even bother to change the picture.  I’d never left Ghana before, but I took a one-way flight to New York City.  I presented myself at the JFK customs counter, and said:  ‘You have to help me. They’re trying to make me king.’ (Akwamufie, Ghana)




When I was eighteen, a large group of students visited Ghana from the UK for a youth development program.  It was an expensive program.  It cost thousands of pounds.  But I got to join for free because they needed some Ghanaians for a smattering of cultural diversity.  The program was a mixture of community service and adventure.  We actually came canoeing on this very lake.  The whole time I was thinking about how much money was being made from our natural resources.  And how much of that money was leaving Ghana.  I became determined to make Ghana money out of the Ghana environment.  So after graduating college, I set out to build a world-class adventure company.  It’s been over five years now.  We have twelve full time employees and twenty-five adventure locations.  Best of all, I think we’re creating an adventure culture in the country.  Our clients were 70 percent foreign when we started.  Now they’re 80 percent Ghanaian.  Behind me is Survival Island.  It’s my latest project and biggest risk yet.  I constructed a full ropes course, and one day I hope to build the world’s longest zip line.  That would really put Ghana on the adventure map.(Accra, Ghana)




It first happened when I was trying to save money for high school.  A man offered to help me.  He’d give me food sometimes.  I’d cook for him and watch his children.  But then one night he asked me to sleep with him, and I refused, so he locked the door and raped me.  A different boss forced himself on me during a trip and gave me $100 to keep quiet.  It’s happened about ten times.  It’s not just employers.  It’s anyone who offers to help.  I’m very religious and my faith would never allow me to do such a thing.  But I’m not strong enough.  There are times when I’m so desperate.  I have kids.  I can’t buy food.  I can’t buy prescriptions.  And someone offers help.  They tell me they just want to help, but I know in the back of my mind what’s going to happen.  I go with them because I have no choice.  And I feel so much guilt afterwards.  Of course I don’t tell anyone.  I just cry and pray for forgiveness.(Accra, Ghana)


A few years ago my marriage was breaking down.  I was depressed.  I wanted to leave.  But when I tried speaking to my friends about it, most people told me to ‘suck it up.’  They told me not to be selfish, and to think of my children.  Church members told me that I’d go to hell.  Family members told me that an unhappy marriage was better than being alone.  Above all, everyone told me to keep quiet.  There’s a taboo in our culture against ‘airing dirty laundry.’  Therapy is stigmatized.  So I had nobody to talk to.  During that time, I’d lock myself up for days and cry.  Luckily there was Qwarme.  We grew up together.  We’ve been friends since high school.  He understood me.   But most of all, he just listened.  The experience gave us an idea to start a listening channel for other people who needed to talk.  I bought a new phone number.  We put out a call on social media, inviting anyone to call in anonymously and share their problems.  I do most of the listening.  But if they’d rather speak to a male, then Qwarme steps in.  We’ve helped almost seventy people in the last three years.  It’s become a round-the-clock job.  Some people call us every day.  Others will call once a month but talk for hours.  Occasionally we’ll recommend a therapist if it seems like professional help is needed.  But other than that, we just listen.  And for most people, that’s enough.(Accra, Ghana)




My mom was left with eight children when my father died.  I had to help raise my siblings because I was the oldest.  I tried working as a seamstress, but it wasn’t enough.  I had to supplement my income by selling eggs.  I’d buy my eggs every morning from the same woman.  But one morning she sold me bad eggs.  Twenty crates of them.  They were too small to sell.  But I just started praying, and I heard a voice telling me to come to this spot.  By the end of the day I’d sold every crate.  And this is where my business has been ever since.  I raised my siblings with this business.  I bought land.  I got married.  I divorced my womanizing husband.  I raised my children.  And then I raised my siblings’ children.  I did it all on my own.  I’ve never had help from anybody.  But without this business, I’d have been helpless.  (Accra, Ghana)




I was eighteen years old.  I went out one night with a male cousin and his friends.  I felt safe with him.  But he gave me a drink and I started to not feel like myself.  He took me home to his house.  It was dark inside and I could hear people moving around.  I heard murmuring in the shadows.  I tried to lock myself in the washroom.  But they beat down the door.  It lasted all night.  They took turns.  I was still a virgin when it happened.  I had goals for myself.  I’d started reading at a very young age.  I wanted to go to school.  But that night everything changed.  I didn’t leave my bedroom for months.  I wasn’t going to tell anyone.  But unfortunately for me, I got pregnant.  I was forced to tell my family.  My father didn’t believe me.  He said: ‘If you’re old enough to get pregnant, you’re old enough to live on your own.’  He kicked me out of the house.  He told me: ‘You’ve used your body once.  You can use it again.’  I had to beg on the street.  I’d go for days without eating.  I hid in the bushes outside my house and begged my siblings for food.  But they avoided me like I was a disease.  I had to abort the baby.  I wasn’t mad at the child, but I had no choice.  I was completely alone.  That was twenty years ago, and I survived.  I’m financially comfortable now.  And maybe I’ve found some peace.  But I’ve never healed.  I don’t want anyone in my life.  I got married once but I hated the sex too much.  Even then I felt alone.  I’ll always live like I have nobody.  I’ve made a few friends, but in the back of my mind, I’m on my own.  Because I don’t want to feel vulnerable.  I don’t want to feel weak.  I don’t want to cry.  I don’t ever want to need anyone again.(Accra, Ghana)




My father wants me to work in government, but I think there are plenty of problems we can solve ourselves.  So I’d rather be an entrepreneur.  Two issues we have in this country are erratic power and excess trash.  So recently I’ve been dreaming of a waste-to-energy plant.  It could be a solution to both problems.  I’ve been researching on the Internet for months.  The technology exists.  But this morning I had a meeting with the electric company, and they told me the power supply is currently stable.  There isn’t a market for extra energy.  So I’m feeling a little disappointed. But I’m going to explore other ideas.  I’m also researching methods to manufacture furniture with leftover sugarcane fiber.  I just want to do something about all this waste.  It makes me so angry.  Our gutters are filled.  Our bins are overflowing.  I’ve been carrying this trash for a mile because there’s nowhere to put it.  And nobody feels responsibility for the problem.  In the village where I grew up, everything was clean.  Because everyone viewed the land as their own.  I wish we’d view our entire country like that.  Personally, I don’t want anyone calling Ghana dirty.(Accra, Ghana)




We had a big discussion whether to raise him in Africa or move to the states.  We both grew up in Ghana.  But I got my PhD in West Virginia, so moving to America was an option.  The job opportunities would certainly be better there.  Both of us are professors, and you’d probably laugh if you knew what we got paid here.  Healthcare would be better too.  You don’t hear of people dying in America because they can’t find an open hospital bed.  But despite these things, we decided to raise our son here.  Because he’d never have to think about the color of his skin.  We never have to explain what it means to be black.  Or the rules of being black.  One day in West Virginia I got an Amber Alert on my phone.  All it said was: ‘tall black male.’  I was the only one in sight so I nearly panicked.  Then another day I was walking back to my dormitory.  I’d just finished teaching a course.  Someone drove by in a red truck, threw a hamburger at my head, and called me the ‘N Word.’  It was 3 o’clock in the afternoon.  I don’t want to explain that stuff to my child.  It’s exhausting to be conscious of your skin all the time.  You either become militant or you become defeated.  And I understand why it happens, but extremes of anything aren’t good.  (Accra, Ghana)


My mother had a lot of problems in her life, so I grew up without her.  It was a difficult childhood.  Everything that I’ve accomplished came from the kindness of others.  My first angel was my grandmother, who let me live with her.  My second angel was my first grade teacher.  Her name was Madam Felicia.  I had no confidence when I met her.  I thought I was dull because I never did well on my examinations.  But she saw greatness in me.  She taught me how to study and think.  Then in fourth grade I met my third angel, Madam Faustina.  She was also my teacher.  After hearing my story, I think she decided to take me as her son.  She promised to support me as long as I worked hard.  She grew me up.  She taught me the Bible.  She paid for my books and school fees.  I’m in university now, but even yesterday she called to see if I needed anything.  I’m currently studying to be a lecturer.  I’m taking three different majors.  I want to help people.  It’s only natural because of all the people who helped me.  I feel like there are so many people out there who can do great things, but are doomed unless they find someone to help them.  (Accra, Ghana)


My parents didn’t have any money, so I began living with my uncle when I was fifteen.  For years he treated me like his own son.  Anything I asked of him, he would give me.  We played music together.  We sang in the choir together.  But when he met a new woman, everything changed.  He suddenly decided to stop providing for me.  I couldn’t buy myself food or clothes anymore.  I felt betrayed.  So I snuck into his room and took some money from his drawer.  His new girlfriend caught me.  And she told my uncle when he came home.  I cried when he confronted me.  But there was nothing I could say.  I knew that I had to leave the house.  My situation was desperate.  I had nothing to eat.  I moved in with a friend, and some days we’d share a single bowl of curry.  I was forced to figure things out.  I began to work harder.  I found a job as a cleaner.  Now I’m studying to be a chef.   I’m twenty-five years old, and for the first time in my life I’m standing on my own two feet.  I haven’t spoken to my uncle since that day.  But I’m going to see him in a couple weeks.  I realize now that I was too old to be depending on him.  I felt entitled to his generosity.  And when he took it away, I betrayed him.  He wanted me to become a man.  So I want to tell him that I understand.  And ‘thank you.’  And ‘I’m sorry.'(Accra, Ghana)


I had some experience with abuse as a young child.  Victims are shamed in our culture, so I couldn’t talk to anyone.  I had to deal with it myself.  I had to grow out of it.  I tried to cope by reading books about the human brain.  I learned how to heal, and move on, and not be bitter.  Only later did I discover that all this was something called ‘psychology.’  I only wanted to get to the point where I didn’t feel shame anymore.  And the more I learned, the more I became determined to feel comfortable with sex.  I joined sex forums online.  I experimented.  I had threesomes.  Eventually I learned so much that I decided to become an educator.  I’ve moderated about fifteen discussions so far.  I call it: ‘The Sex Talk.’  I’ve spoken at church groups.  I’ve spoken at schools.  And it’s taken a lot of courage.  Because people in this country think that if you’re speaking about it, you’re encouraging it. But I think secrecy is what’s harmful.  Why not explain sex to kids?  We show them how to do everything else.  They need to know that these feelings are natural, and that they have a brain to keep them in check.  Either we educate people about sex, or they’ll be confused by it.  And if they’re confused by it, they’ll be shamed by it.  And if they’re shamed by it, they’ll be controlled by it.   (Accra, Ghana)


I’m on the way to buy soft drinks for my mother.  I also fetch water, and sweep, and help her wash clothes.  She calls me ‘boss’ because I work so hard, but I love to help her because she cares for me so much.  She buys me clothes.  She reads me storybooks.  She sings me gospel songs.  She helps me with my homework.  She gives me medicine when I’m sick.  One time she baked my friend a cake because his parents couldn’t afford any presents.  I’m going to buy her a house one day. She’s very dark and beautiful.  I really have a wonderful mother.  (Accra, Ghana)
