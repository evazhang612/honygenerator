My husband is a mechanic, but his business is slow.  It’s not enough.  I’m selling this so my children can go to school.  I want them to go above me.  I want them to be a great someone in this country.  When I see them happy, I feel happy.  Every time I pay their school fees, they tell me: ‘Mommy you are the best mommy.’  So I’m out here all day in the sun.  Then I go home, I cook, I bathe, I put them to bed, and then I go to sleep.  I’ve been sick with malaria this past week.  I haven’t been able to work.  My husband wants me to rest but the kids are beginning to cry from hunger.  The stress is too much for him alone.  When I was lying in bed, I just kept praying: ‘God, help me go sell.’  But every time I went outside, my fever was too much.  My body felt too cold.  And I had to go back inside.  Today is my first day back to work.  I woke up with no headache, but it’s so bad right now.  There’s pain all over my body.  I’m just hoping to sell enough to buy tomorrow’s supply.

The first time I was offered a journalism job in Nigeria, the newspaper owner suggested that I supplement my income with bribes.  He told me: ‘I’m giving you a platform.  Use what you have to get what you need.’  I knew then that the rumors were true.  Journalism in this country was corrupted.  There was no idealism.  Reporters were writing stories for money.  And even more damaging, they were killing stories for money.  I didn’t want to participate.  I felt it would be more ethical to just find a corporate job.  But in 2008, I was given the opportunity to manage a new paper founded by Nigeria’s only Pulitzer Prize winner, Dele Olojede.  The paper was called Next.  And we tried to change things.  We hired young people who were untainted by the culture.  Half of them were women.  We paid them well and we trained them well.  Ethics came first.  Accepting gifts was absolutely forbidden.  Our paper survived for three years.  During that time, we broke major stories every single week.  We exposed all sorts of corruption.  But we were targeted for our success.  Our reporters were detained.  Our board members were threatened.  The government leaned on our advertisers, and they withdrew one by one.  Eventually we were forced to close.  But for three years we set the pace.  We created a mold.  And I believe we changed the media landscape.  Investigative journalism is stronger now.  Many of our journalists have gone on to start amazing publications of their own.  The paper may have been short lived, but I know it had an impact.  Revolution is too strong of a word, but we definitely shook the table.(Lagos, Nigeria)


I want to live a happy life.  I’m tired of living a poor life.  I’m trying to save money for school but nothing is working.  I’ve left home three different times looking for work.  The first time I found a job as a housekeeper.  But every morning when I got dressed the man would try to touch me.  I was only seventeen.  He wouldn’t even stop when I threatened to tell on him.  His wife blamed me for his attention. She beat me severely.  There were bruises all over my body.  She didn’t even allow me to eat.  But I tried to stay because I wanted to go to school so badly.  Then one morning he tried to rape me in the bath, and I finally ran away.  When I found a new housekeeping job, the same thing happened.  This time it was a pastor.  So a few weeks ago I switched to a cleaning job at an art gallery.  But they just fired me for speaking to the visitors.  I don’t know why this always happens to me.  It makes me so angry.  I get mad at my parents for being poor.  I get mad at my friends for going to school.  When I see their graduation pictures on Facebook, I just start crying.  I’m already twenty years old.  I should be finishing school, but I haven’t even started yet.  But everything has it’s own time.  Hopefully my time will come too.  (Lagos, Nigeria)


My uncle was an engineer.  He’s the one that exposed me to reading.  He’d get a book, finish it, and give it to me.  By the time I was twenty I’d read over one thousand books.  I learned how to live from the characters I encountered.  The first book I ever read was The Passport of Malam Illia, and to this day it’s the reason I never take vengeance.  And there’s plenty to be angry about around here.  Most of my friends are poor.  When we were growing up, police would come to the slum in the evening, pick up my friends, and beat them for no reason.  It made me so angry.  But books also taught me that we have the power to change things.  We can fight for lower fuel prices.  We can fight for better medical facilities.  I’m actually heading to a protest right now.  We haven’t had electricity in this slum for ten days.  Why?  Because last month we protested and now they’re trying to punish us.  But we won’t sit down.  Too many poor people don’t realize their own power because they’ve been subjugated for too long.  They’re like the chickens I keep in my house.  Every time I whistle, the chickens come.  Even when I don’t have food in my hand.  And that’s how people think.  They believe that only government has the power to give.  But anything the government has power to give, we have the power to take for ourselves.  (Lagos, Nigeria)




My father died young, but my mother was well-to-do.  I was an only child and she took care of me well.  She promised me at a young age that she’d send me to Oxford University.  So I studied hard.  My best subject was English.  I wanted to be a lecturer.  But my mother passed away the same year that I graduated high school.  She’d been sick for so long.  Our assets were depleted from the hospital bills.  There were no jobs in our village, so I came to the city looking for greener pastures.  I taught myself to sew, and now I make men’s suits.  It’s not the type of work I wanted to do.  I’m tired all the time.  Business is slow.  Life is expensive.  It’s frustrating when you work twelve hours a day and can’t even feed your family well.  We don’t have a television.  We don’t have a radio.  Because everything I have left, I spend on their school.  They’re good students.  I encourage them to study hard.  I always tell them to focus because I want them to go far.  And anything I can remember from school, I teach them myself.  (Lagos, Nigeria)


It wasn’t sudden.  He was born four months early.  The organs didn’t have enough time to mature.  He just wasn’t ready for life.  But he held on for more than two years.  He was such a happy child.  He laughed so hard when you rocked him.  We called him ‘Bibi,’ because his older brother couldn’t say ‘baby.’  Toward the end, he was learning to stand on his own.  We honestly thought he was going to make it.  But his immune system was just too weak from all the medication.  And his lungs were too weak from all the machines.  He couldn’t survive.  I had a hard childhood growing up.  This place makes you tough.  Nigerians and cockroaches will be the last living things on this planet.  I can remember being nine years old, and sitting down with my brothers to make a plan when we ran out of food.  Our only idea was to drink a lot of water.  So I’ve always had to be strong.  When my brother died, I couldn’t mourn.  I was the oldest in the family.  I had to hold it together and make arrangements.  But not this time.  After Bibi, I decided that I don’t ever have to be strong again.  That was my child.  I can’t button this one up.  Either I allow myself to be weak, or I’m never going to get through it.  (Lagos, Nigeria)




I had a lonely childhood.  I didn’t have many friends.  I spent a lot of time writing depressing poetry in my room.  But everything changed the first time I saw someone perform a spoken word poem.  It was at a fellowship meeting.  I never realized that poetry could impact an audience like that.  After the meeting, the girl invited me to join her poetry club.  There were seven members.  They met every Thursday under a guava tree in the school courtyard.  It was a place for me to just write, and to read what I’d written.  It was a place where I felt accepted and got critical feedback.  I got better at writing.  I grew more confident.  Eventually I performed in front of larger audiences, and my projects got more ambitious.  Now I’m working on a book.  It’s been my main focus for the last four years.  It’s about a little girl who’s misunderstood.  She’s an artist.  She wants to be recognized and understood.  But everyone around her thinks she’s a witch.  When I began writing the book, the character was based on myself.  But I’m so different than her now.  I’m not depressed anymore.  I’m closer to my family.  I don’t feel so isolated.  But I’m not sure she’s gotten there yet.   I’m struggling to not impose my growth onto her journey.  As a writer you’re supposed to detach yourself from your character.  But when you’ve included so many elements of yourself, and you’ve evolved so much, it’s really hard to do.  (Lagos, Nigeria)


I’m a community leader here.  I watch over about eighty people.  We meet every month, and I try to bring their concerns to the government.  They also look to me for guidance on how to vote.  Hardly any of them are educated.  Most of us have nothing.  I’m lucky because I work as a street cleaner, but my salary hasn’t been paid in three months.  But if we try to feed ourselves by hawking articles on the side of the road, the government will put us in jail.  We need jobs.  We need clean water.  We need good roads.  The politicians promise these things before every election.  They visit the neighborhood, and tell us this time it will be different.  But after the election they disappear.  I’ve been to the minister’s office so many times.  Every time his receptionist tells me that he’s in a meeting.  I sit there all day.  The meeting never ends.  But he’ll show up again when the election comes around, carrying eighty packages of noodles, and a polo shirt with his name on it.  (Lagos, Nigeria)




I attribute my success to getting to know God early in life.  Where I grew up, it was easy to go wayward.  And it was risky to go wayward.  Thankfully I studied the Bible enough to know the definition of sin.  It taught me right from wrong.  If I’d been out there trying to figure it out myself, I’d have taken too many wrong turns.  I’d probably have gotten pregnant at a young age.  I definitely wouldn’t be an architect right now.  Maybe some people can do it without God.   But not many people in my neighborhood were reading books about morality and ethics.  We weren’t being taught the seven habits of highly effective people.  But we did have the word of God.  I relied on it.  And it carried me through. (Lagos, Nigeria)


I just drove by a man being beaten by police.  He was a bus driver.  He’d been pulled from his bus, pinned to the ground, and beaten with sticks in front of his passengers.  It’s not uncommon.  He probably refused to pay their bribe.  I see it two or three times a month.  Sometimes it’s fists.  Sometimes it’s sticks.  Sometimes it’s whips.  You can try to take a photo but it’s dangerous.  Because then they can turn on you.  So you just keep driving.  It makes me sick because I work as a driver, and I know that one day it might happen to me.  I never drive through yellow lights.  It’s too dangerous.  Sometimes they’ll even force you into a violation.  They’ll purposely direct you the wrong way down a ‘one way’ street.  If that happens, you don’t argue.  You don’t try to defend yourself.  You will lose no matter what.  You just start begging.  (Lagos, Nigeria)




It happened in May.  I was driving my friend’s Mercedes to school because my car had broken down.  And suddenly I got pulled over.  I turned on the interior lights.  I showed the policemen my ID.  I called my friend on the phone and asked him to explain the situation.  But they said: ‘Not enough, get out of the car.’  They started calling me a prostitute.  I told them I’m an artist.  Then they saw my laptop in the backseat, and they tried calling me an Internet scammer.  They asked me to open my computer and type in the password.  I told them it wasn’t possible.  Then they asked for a huge bribe, and I told them it wasn’t possible.  That’s when they cocked their guns at me.  One of them got in the front seat.  He pointed his gun at me and told me to drive to an ATM.  I brought him to this exact spot, and he escorted me to the machine.  I left the car running.  I maxed out one of my cards, and told him that I have go back and get another one.  Then I locked the door and started driving away.  That’s when he started shooting at me!  All of this was captured on surveillance cameras.  I sped away.  I was taking short cuts and back roads.  The whole time I was thinking I’m about to get killed.  When I got home, I found four dents in the car from where the bullets hit.  Afterwards I contacted the police, and they said they wouldn’t even speak to me unless I deleted the story from social media.  I said: ‘I’m not doing that.  I’m a law student.’ (Lagos, Nigeria)




They’re called Yahoo Boys.  The name comes from the old days when they used Yahoo email accounts to scam people.  I first started seeing them when I went to the University of Lagos.  They form little gangs.  They travel in convoys where all the cars are the same color.  They’re always on their laptops.  These days a lot of them are legitimized.  They rent office space.  They refer to their targets as ‘clients.’  They start charities.  They put their fraud money into other businesses.  Some of them have Instagram accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers.  They post pictures of their cars and clothes.  They never mention where they got their money, but everyone knows.  A lot of them buy art from me.  Since a lot of their scams are emotional fraud, they’ll even ask me for advice on things that women would say in a relationship.  Or they’ll ask me to pick up their phone and pretend to be a secretary.  I never participate.   Recently I’ve even stopped selling them paintings.  It’s cost me a lot.  But I can’t take their money without feeling complicit.  (Lagos, Nigeria)




When I was the age of this boy, my father had a stroke.  My family used all our savings to take care of him.  And after we’d spent everything, my father gave up the ghost.  We were left in a desperate situation.  There was no money left.  There were six of us living in a single room.  I was only in 5th grade, but I had to go to work.  I carried oranges on my head and sold them in the street.  Then one day I met the owner of a print shop.  He was a friend of my brother.  He fed me every afternoon, and he began to teach me his profession.  He told me: ‘Never view yourself as having nothing.’  And he showed me that I could change my life with skills alone.  Now I have my own shop.  And anyone who has an interest, I will teach them.  I’ve taught fourteen boys already.  This boy has stopped going to school.  But we can’t allow him to be idle.  We must keep him busy because there’s criminality all around us.  Every day we see drug dealers walk by.  I point to them and I ask: ‘Do you want to be like them?  Or do you want to be like me?’(Lagos, Nigeria)




My mother won the visa lottery, so when I was young my family relocated to Minnesota.  I think I’m the only one of my siblings who always viewed Nigeria as home.  I participated in Model UN.  I studied international political science.  I admired Nelson Mandela.  So I always knew I’d go back to Africa one day.  After graduation I interned with an NGO in Northern Nigeria.  During that trip I witnessed a breached birth in a village.  There was no C-Section available, so the baby died.  I knew then that not only would I be coming home to Nigeria, but I’d be doing something in healthcare.  I’ve been home for six years now.  I’ve chosen to work on the country’s blood distribution problem.  Every year tens of thousands of people die while waiting for blood.  Meanwhile there are blood banks discarding unused inventory.  My company LifeBank is trying to close that gap.  Most blood banks in Lagos are participating in our program.  Every morning we take an inventory.  And when blood is urgently needed, we use bikes to deliver.  It’s not easy.  Imagine New York City without the infrastructure and no subway system.  That’s Lagos.  Yet LifeBank has delivered over 10,000 bags of blood within 55 minutes.  Blood shortage is a global problem.  And if we can do it in Lagos, we can do it anywhere.  In December we’re expanding to two new cities.  But I see us all over the world.  (Lagos, Nigeria)




Shortly after arriving in Lagos, my guide showed me a story that was being passed around Nigerian social media.  There was a woman who’d been stopped in traffic behind a crowded prison truck, and she witnessed a food vendor running alongside, shoving his food between the bars of the window, into the hands of the prisoners inside. By the time he was finished, he’d given away all his food.  The man was himself in desperate circumstances.  He was sleeping outdoors.  But despite having hardly anything to give, he gave away all his merchandise.  Amazingly, my guide Kola was able to locate the man.  His name is Ibere Ugochukwu.  And this is his story:   A few years ago I worked as an apprentice in a cosmetics shop.  I was supposed to receive a payment at the end of my term.  But I was warned by the other employees that the owner would find a reason not to pay me.  He’d always invent reasons to fire his boys right before their payment.  So I made the decision to quit.  But when I told him, he dragged me to the police.  He told them lies about me.  He told them I’d stolen so much money.  And they tortured me.  They tied my hands and legs and they hung me from the ceiling.  They beat me.  I went deaf from all the slaps.  For ten days I was given no food.  My fellow prisoners would share little bits of their meals when they were finished.  But some days I saw nothing.  Honestly I was about to die.  And I started to pray to God.  And on the tenth day, the guards decided that it would cause too much trouble to let me die.  They told my employer: ‘After what we did to him, he must be innocent.  Because he’d have confessed if he was guilty.'  They released me into the world like a madman.  And I’ve carried the memory ever since.  I promised myself that if I ever found someone in a similar situation, I would help.  So when I learned that prisoners pass down this road, I chose to hawk in this location.  I waited until I finally saw the truck, and I pushed all my food through the bars.  My fellow vendors couldn’t believe it.  They asked me who would pay me for the food.  I told them: ‘I didn’t do it for any man.  I did it because of what God did for me.’  (Lagos, Nigeria)




I’m studying human development.  A few years ago I came across an article that said there were no successful black nations in the world.  It really angered me.  I thought: ‘Some fellow is trying to run us down.’  But then I discovered the author of the article was Nigerian.  And the more I read, the more I realized it was true.  And I started to think that maybe we should be mad at ourselves.  I always hear my friends complaining about the politicians in this country.  I tell them: ‘Imagine that lightning strikes and suddenly you’re the president.  Would you know enough honest people to form a government?’  And they freeze.  Because our culture doesn’t ascribe a premium to honesty.  People will laugh at you for being honest and broke.  Nigeria has the highest concentration of black people in the world.  So this is where it should happen.  But development doesn’t begin with things, it begins with people.  I’m not saying that self-criticism is the answer.  But it’s the beginning of the answer.  Maybe we should be a little less proud and a little more discontent.  Maybe we should stop blaming our immorality on poverty.  I grew up in the slums and I don’t want to hear it.  Don’t blame it on colonialism, nepotism, racism, or any of the ‘isms.’  And don’t blame it on the slave trade.  Because slavery didn’t begin with white people.  White people purchased slaves from our shores, that’s true.  But black people did the selling.  And we were paid for what we sold. (Lagos, Nigeria)




In my church you’re either Christian or possessed by demons. We have services four times per week.  Luckily zoning out looks a lot like praying.  I’m not saying that I don’t believe any of it.  I just have a lot of questions that nobody will answer.  Whenever I ask a hard question, they just show me a bible quote that says I shouldn’t ask questions.  It doesn’t make sense to me.  I think I’m becoming a Nihilist.  Honestly, I don’t see any reason why people should be born.  You exist, then you strive to attain something to make sense of your existence, and then you don’t exist anymore.  Can’t we cut out some of those steps?  It’s just too much work.  I didn’t sign up for this.  And when you finally die, instead of everything stopping, you have to become conscious again?  Heaven doesn’t sound that great.  Supposedly there’s a lot of singing and trumpets.  That sounds exhausting.  I’d rather be sleeping.(Lagos, Nigeria)




You can’t just use Beyoncé to sell products in Nigeria.  Well, maybe Beyoncé is a bad example.  Beyoncé can sell anywhere.  But most of the time you need to adapt your advertising to local tastes.  So I help international companies create marketing campaigns for Nigeria.  A few years ago I started my own company.  I’d gotten tired of working for someone else.  I was doing all the work on some projects, and I’d only walk away with peanuts.  So I took the leap.  My goal was to win a single bid that first year.  I just needed one big name to risk a little money on me.  Because a little money to them was a lot of money to me.  I knew I had the technical experience.  I had the ‘know how.’  I just didn’t have an office, or a staff, or a big name.  But that became my pitch.  I argued that bigger agencies take their clients for granted.  I told companies: ‘I’m not relaxed like that.  I’m hungry.  I’m going to give you more juice.’  My first client ended up being Coca Cola.   Maybe I didn’t have things quite as figured out as I allowed them to believe.  But hey, that’s advertising.  And I delivered.(Lagos, Nigeria)




I used to walk 12 kilometers to school.  And every day along the side of the road, there’d be an old woman who was so sick that she couldn’t move.  The sun would beat her.  The rain would beat her.  And nobody would help.  I was only seven years old.  I couldn’t stand it.  But my parents wouldn’t agree to bring a total stranger into our house.  How are we OK with people dying like chickens on the side of the road?  Millions of people in this country haven’t even taken a single meal today.  I can’t stand it.  I’m thirty now and I’m struggling.  But I’m still trying to help even though I don’t have money.  I taught myself to treat diabetes with herbs.  I’ve treated ten people so far who can’t afford the hospital.   But I want to do more.  I’ve given myself a timeframe.  I’ve been working at this conservation center for three years now, and I’ve learned a lot.  In a few years I’m going to open my own center.  I can use the profits to build houses for people who have no place to stay.  Each person can stay for a year.  Maybe if they can just rest their head for a month, they’ll find a way to feed themselves.  And if they eat for a week, they’ll start to reason like a human being.  At the very least they’ll see that it’s possible to be loved by someone.  And maybe they’ll realize that God loves them too.(Lagos, Nigeria)




I was a baby when I got married.  I was only thirteen.  I didn’t have an adolescence.  One day I’m a child going to school, and the next day I’m a mother, responsible for a home.  I cried too much.  I didn’t know the person I married.  He turned out to be a cold man.  He had zero communication or understanding.  I suffered for so long, but I endured it all so that I could raise my children well.  But every human has a ceiling, and once you hit it, it’s over.  For three years I planned my escape.  I waited until my children were older.  Then one morning I left the keys on the table, dropped my kids off at school, and headed straight for the courts.  I finally have freedom.  I’m laid back.  I’m relaxed.  I can express my opinion.  I do whatever I want.  I just finished a wonderful vacation in Egypt with my daughter.  Nobody causes me trouble anymore.  These are the best years of my life.  (Cairo, Egypt)




When I was a boy I’d skip school to sell roses on the street.  My parents gave up trying to educate me.  They said: ‘He’s lost his mind over the roses.’  I wanted to be around flowers all the time.  I sold so many that I opened my own kiosk across from a famous country club.  But I could never sell on Fridays.  The police would close our entire street so the governor could visit the club.  But once I ignored their instructions.  It was the day before Mother’s Day.  My biggest day of the year.  So I took a chance and remained open.  When the police found out, they confiscated all my flowers.  They even took my license.  It was a fatal blow.  All my money was in those flowers.  I had piles of them.  So I had to start from zero.  I’m a street vendor again.  For awhile I was ashamed, but I’m fine with it now.  It’s better than working for someone.  I buy the roses I want, and sell them to whoever I want.  Maybe I’ll have a shop again.  But as long as I’m around my roses, I’ll always feel peaceful.  (Cairo, Egypt)




My mom has nobody to care for her but me.  The last stroke affected her brain so badly.  She’s like the living dead.  All she can do now is breathe.  Last month I found a small wound on her toe.  I thought it was something small.  It looked so small.  So I just put a bandage on it.  But it was the beginning of gangrene.  I should have known.  It spread and the doctors had to amputate her leg.  It’s all my fault, but I was under so much pressure.  I’m a single mom.  I work as a housekeeper.  What do I focus on? What do I pay for?  My kids’ education?  Food?  My mom’s care?  It’s just too much.  It’s all on me.  I called my sister last week and screamed at her.  I screamed at her for never calling.  I screamed at her for not helping.  I told her that I wished she would die.   And my wish came true.  Four days ago she passed away.  When I saw her at the morgue, she had no hair, no eyebrows, nothing.  She had been hiding cancer from us.  I feel so guilty.  My wish came true.  But I didn’t know because she never called!  I haven’t eaten since yesterday.  Only a cup of milk.  I can’t keep doing this. It’s too much pressure.  I’m not doing well.  I’m not OK.(Cairo, Egypt)


I read a lot on the subject.  I studied the texts.  And I decided it was permissible to take it off, so that’s what I did.  My mom was terrified of what people would think.  She asked me to delete all our mutual friends on Facebook.  She said if I didn’t wear the hijab, then I couldn’t live at home.  So I packed four big bags and went to live with a friend.  It was the first time I’d ever slept out of my house.  Over the next few weeks, I sent my parents messages every single day.  I always told them where I was, what I was doing, and who I was with.  I wanted to show that I forgave them, and that I was still their girl, and that one day things would be normal again.  They didn’t respond for three months.  Until one holiday my uncle called and invited me home for dinner.  My parents started crying as soon as I walked in the door.  They’d prepared a huge meal.  They said that they didn’t mean it, and that they love me a lot, and that they’re proud of me.  Things are very good now.  We get along even better than when I obeyed.  They see I’m doing great things with my freedom.  I have a great job and I travel.  They’re very proud.  I’ve learned to do what you want in life.  Because if you do, the world will change to match you.  (Alexandria, Egypt)




The entrepreneurial community in Egypt is a bit like a baby.  It’s still learning to speak, and to read, and to understand.  It exists, but only a small number of people have access.  You must have connections. Because without them, it’s impossible to grow a business.  There are too many layers of bureaucracy.  Every decision requires a permit, and every permit requires a signature. A business can be stalled for months waiting on a single approval.  Unless you have connections, then everything can be fixed with a single phone call.  This dynamic must change.  The system needs to work for everybody.  The country will never be competitive unless entrepreneurs are able to move fast.  But I don’t think the answer is government.  The answer is entrepreneurship itself.  Our start-ups must begin making money. Because money means control.  And when entrepreneurs are in control, things will start working.(Cairo, Egypt)




My husband died a long time ago.  He was in a car accident.  My daughter was only four years old at the time, and I was pregnant with my son.  But I overcame it all.  Life is difficult but God is generous.  I found a job working at this building.  I’m an old lady now, but if anything is needed from the store, or anything needs to be cleaned, I can still do it.  I’ve been here for 50 years, in a little apartment on the roof.  I raised my children up there.  All of the people in the building love me.  They’re like my family.  They tell me: ‘Anything you need for your house, just let us know.’  Whenever I’m sick, they always call me.  They say: ‘Where were you yesterday?’  And it’s not just the people in this building.  The whole neighborhood loves me.  I mean, they’re practically my own.  I raised every one of them.   (Cairo, Egypt)


I was married when I was seventeen.  My whole life was my family.  I barely left the house because my husband brought me everything I needed.  I was far too innocent.  I had no idea about anything, but the world has a way of teaching you.  Fifteen years ago my husband died and I had to take the lead of the family.  He owned an upholstery shop.  The workers tried to convince me to let them handle the business, but they were hiding the profits from me.  I had to take over.  There was no other choice.  My kids were still in school and that money belonged to them.  So I began going to the shop every day.  At first the workers tried to box me out.  They knew I didn’t understand the business so they wouldn’t explain anything.  They hid the numbers from me.  And when a client entered the store, they wouldn’t even introduce me as the owner.  But I sat there and watched every move they made.  I memorized everything.  And after forty days, there were some new rules at the shop.  The workers were not allowed to speak to the client directly.(Cairo, Egypt)


I’ve had horrible luck finding a husband.  Most marriages in this country are traditional, and I have a middleman who arranges interviews with potential suitors.  He probably thinks I’m a snob.  Because I either turn the men down or scare them off.  But you should hear the questions they ask me.  Nothing about personality.  Nothing about character.  Everything is about money: ‘What is your salary?’,  ‘Do you have a car?,  ‘Is this your only apartment?’  I used to answer these questions, but I’m much harsher now.  I’ll dismiss them right away.  I’ve had men ask me to stop working.  I had a professor ask me to stop studying because I have more degrees than him.  Another man ended the interview when he learned that my ‘doctorate’ did not mean I was a medical doctor.  It’s ridiculous.  Some friends and family want me to settle for the sake of having children.  But I have a viewpoint, and I’m not going to sacrifice that viewpoint just because I’m getting older.  I believe in marriage.  And I’d like children.  But if it means I have to accept anything, maybe it’s best to not get married at all.(Alexandria, Egypt)


This is my brother.  We’re helping people into their parking spots.  School starts in a few days and we’re trying to raise money for our school fees.  Also I want to get a bicycle because all my friends have bicycles.  They use their bicycles to make me angry because I don’t have one.  But wait until I get my bicycle.  They’ll be so angry.  We’ve been saving our money for three months.  But sometimes we buy Pepsi.  And also peanuts.  And yesterday a street vendor came by with jewelry, and my brother bought me this necklace.  And he also bought me a watch but it broke.  And a ring but I lost it.  He really loves me so much.   (Cairo, Egypt)


He always wanted a daughter.  He tells me that all the time.  My friends think I’m so lucky because a lot of their dads aren’t affectionate.  Some have even been forced to stop studying and get married.  But my father wants me to be successful.  He wants me to live abroad.  More than anything, he’s a friend. There was a time in high school when I was extremely depressed.  Mostly just teenage things.  I felt ugly.  I didn’t have confidence.  But it got so bad that I started having scary thoughts.  And I didn’t want to tell anyone, especially my parents.  I was afraid I’d get locked away in the house.  But one night we were sitting in my bedroom, and I finally let him know.  His reaction wasn’t what I expected.  He didn’t panic or scream.  He was calm.  He just kept holding me and saying: ‘We’ll get through this together.’(Alexandria, Egypt)


Mom said: "You wear this, and you wear that.'"  (Alexandria, Egypt)


I’d always dreamed of getting a college degree, but I got married right after high school.  We started having children right away, so it wasn’t easy to convince my husband to let me study.  The one time I tried to mention it, he immediately said ‘no.’  But a few years later we were in the passport office and I saw an advertisement for a university.  I pulled on his sleeve, pointed at the sign, and said: ‘Lets take a look.  It’s only a look.’  That very same day I enrolled in classes.  Each night I’d wait until 2 AM, after everyone’s demands had been answered, and the whole house was asleep.  Then I’d begin my studying. I’d work until morning, wake the children up, and prepare them for school.  Only then could I rest.  It was exhausting but I was so happy.  It felt like I’d gone back in time and my kids were my siblings.  During my third year I was pregnant again, and I was terrified that I’d go into labor during my final exams.  But I got my diploma.  It was the happiest day of my life.  My husband was thrilled for me.  Everything is different now.  I understand the world.  I used to be afraid to leave the house.  But now I feel powerful.  And it shows.  (Cairo, Egypt)


My parents aren’t giving me the freedom to be responsible.  Mama’s fine.  But Papa is an Egyptian father.  He wants me to always be in a safe, cozy home.  Recently I wanted to go on an educational trip to Sri Lanka.  I begged him.  I said, ‘Please, I’ll be living with a family.  I’ll call you ten times a day.’  But he wouldn’t listen.  I locked myself in my room and cried.  I wanted that experience.  I wanted to meet beautiful people, and eat beautiful food, and take beautiful photos.  I know my dad very well.  He just doesn’t trust people.  He thinks that I’m naïve.  He thinks that everyone who helps you wants something in return.  But that’s not why I help people.  I love people.  I love languages.  I can even speak a little Hindi.  I want to see every village and every city.  I even want to work for NASA one day.  I love physics and astronomy.  But Papa thinks astronomy is a bad idea.  He doesn’t get it.  It’s not that he doesn’t understand the stars.  He just doesn’t understand me.  (Alexandria, Egypt)


I’m from Basra.  In the seventies we were the economic capital of Iraq.  It was beautiful once.  The only city with two rivers.  We had one million people but ten million palm trees.  In those days everyone was optimistic.  Our oil reserves were better than the Saudis.  We assumed the oil would be invested, and that our lives would keep getting better.  But our leaders failed us.  It was war after war.  Without all the fighting, things could have really been great.  But the palm trees are gone now.  There’s no potable water.  We have a shortage of electricity.  Healthcare is very poor, and cancer is everywhere because the Americans used radioactive bombs.  Our whole land is contaminated.  The food that comes from the soil is poison.  But please visit, you’ll be welcome.  The people are friendly.  You’ll be met with hospitality.  We understand that governments are the warmongers.  You’re victims just like us.  (Cairo, Egypt)


I have two young boys.  And every time we go somewhere, I’m not even thinking about my fun.  I only think about their fun.  I’ve been to the zoo a million times because the small one loves the monkeys.  Last week we went to see Hotel Transylvania III.  I’ve already seen two of those things.  This time the monsters took a vacation.  To be honest, I don’t even think there was a story.  The monsters just kept interacting with people on the boat.  I wasn’t really paying attention, but the boys loved it.  I enjoyed their reactions more than the movie.  I watched their faces the entire time.  And whenever they laughed, I laughed.   (Cairo, Egypt)


My mom is in prison.  I see her every fifteen days.  My siblings take me to visit her, but then they leave me when it’s over.  My grandmother doesn’t want me.  My uncle beats me up.  I have nowhere to live.  The only person I have in my life is my mom.  Every time I visit, she asks me if I’m staying with relatives, and I tell her: ‘Mom, nobody wants me.  I have no one.’  I sleep on the street.  I can’t go to school.  I just hang out with the older kids.  Sometimes we wash cars together for money.  Last week I was washing a man’s car and he bought me clothes and food.  He told me I could sleep at his house.  So maybe I’ll start going there.(Cairo, Egypt)


Papa loves Ibrahim.  He’s my beloved.  He’s my whole world.  I have four other sons, but I love him a little more because he needs it a little more.  The doctors recommended an abortion but I wouldn’t hear it.  He was only three pounds when he was born.  He needed half a liter of milk per day.  I’d skip my own breakfast just to buy it for him.  I took him to nurseries when he was very young because I wanted him to be comfortable with other children.  I found a charity that offered speech classes, and I took him five days a week.  Anything that I have, I will give him.  I only worry what will happen when I’m gone.  I’m getting old.  I had a major heart episode two weeks ago.  I collapsed in the street and all I could think about was him.  My wife can't support him alone, and I’m afraid other people won’t be as nice to him.  If someone makes him angry, he’s very difficult to control.  But I have patience.  I’ll hold him.  I’ll pat him on the shoulder.  I’ll do whatever he needs.  I just hope he'll always have someone to do the same. (Cairo, Egypt)




People scream from their balconies, ‘Don’t play here!’  But where else are we supposed to play?  And they tell us: ‘Don’t play so loud!’  But how do you play not loud?(Cairo, Egypt)


My father was very strict with us.  His workshop was across the street from our apartment building, and he’d scream if he saw us peeking out the window.  It was like a prison.  We’d just stay at home, make him tea and food, and watch TV.  Back then it was mostly black and white movies staring Egyptian icons.  My favorites were the love stories.  But it was just a fantasy for me, because my father swatted away all my suitors.  During that time I fell in love with my grandmother’s neighbor.  He was tall, light-skinned, and wore his hair combed back.  I’d pretend to visit her just so I could see him.  I’d wear my loveliest dresses, get my hair done, and stand outside his window. He’d always smile at me.  I was pretty myself back then.  I loved him.  And he loved me.  He told my friend that he wanted to marry me.  But my father married me off to my cousin, and that’s when the tragedy began.  I gave birth to one child after another.  I’ve had to work full time because my husband is so useless.  He’s a total bum.  But I still live next door to my first love.  He has a university degree.  And every time he sees me, he smiles.   (Cairo, Egypt)


My son was crazy about a woman.  He spent a bunch of money on her.  He even asked her to marry him.  But she didn’t want him and it drove him mad.  He stopped going to work.  His clothes became ripped and his beard grew long.  He looked like someone you’d see in the street.  His personality changed too.  He grew aggressive.  He thought everyone was trying to fight him.  It broke my heart.  It felt like my son was slipping away.  He was only thirty and had given up on the world.  Everyone told me he was cursed.  I tried everything.  I prayed to God.  I went to mosques.  I went to spiritual advisors.  I gave money to psychics, but nothing worked.  Then one day I was sitting in this very spot, and a doctor stopped to visit.  He asked me what was wrong.  I told him everything, and he asked to see my son.  I’ll never forget that day.  That man is the reason for everything good in my life.  He brought my son back to me.  My son is taking medicine now.  He’s working.  He’s shaved.  He’s laughing again.  I still believe that God is the one who healed him.  But thank God for good doctors.(Cairo, Egypt)
We keep waiting for her to turn 78.  For the last twenty years she’s been telling people that she’s 77.  It got a little awkward when some of her kids reached their seventies.  We told her, ‘Mom, it’s going to seem like you gave birth when you were five.’  But she didn’t care.  She’d rationalize it by saying: ’77 is the age I feel.’  She fell and broke her hip two months ago.  But until then she’d always been extremely active.  She’d meet her friends for coffee.  She was on the board of two charities.  She was always alert and kept her sense of humor.  After the accident I drove her to the hospital, and I couldn’t convince her that we needed to tell the doctor she was 97.  And when she finally agreed, she wasn’t too happy about it.  (Cairo, Egypt)




It was basic self-defense.  He threw a big ass rock at me.  Like half a brick.  So I beat him, took his bike, and took his sneakers.  His jaw got wired.  He ended up in some sort of group home.  I was seventeen at the time but, yeah, I’m proud of it.  Technically I was defending myself, but the judge didn’t see it like that.  I was defending my pride.  I was defending my ego.  They gave me seven years.  Now I can’t even get a job.  That bitch ruined my life.  I don’t know why he had to call the police.  He was a rat.  He snitched.  I’d never call the police if that happened to me.  That’s not what you do.  If you’ve got a problem, you just find the guy and fuck him up.


Once when I was fourteen I was getting on the Q Train in Brooklyn.  It was two o’clock in the afternoon.  I was going to a friend’s house.  I swiped my card quickly because the train was coming.  And as I ran to catch it, an undercover police officer just grabbed me.  I remember he was wearing a Jake Plummer Michigan football jersey.  I told him that I’d paid my fare.  I told him he could check my card.  But he pushed me against the wall and started searching through my stuff.  I’ve probably been searched about half a dozen times in my life.  So I don’t have a lot of faith in the system.  I know a lot of people in prison are just unlucky.  Right now I’m finishing up my Masters’ in accounting and my goal is to own my tax firm.  I’d love to employ formally incarcerated individuals one day.  It’s so hard for them to find employment, but I can teach them to do taxes.  It’s something anyone can learn.  They can provide an excellent service, and their history wouldn’t make a difference.


Social media isn’t evil.  There are neuroscientists in some of these companies, but for the most part I don’t think it was done maliciously.  But advertising is the business model.  And if advertising is the business model, our attention becomes the product.  Two variables matter to the bottom line: the amount of users and the amount of time they spend on platform.  And what gets measured gets optimized.  So our phones have become slot machines.  We scroll and scroll and scroll, and eventually we hit something that gives us a dopamine reward.  It’s by design.  Because slot machines make more money in the US than theme parks, baseball, and movies combined.  Both Vegas and Silicon Valley know that our brains can be manipulated if presented with a certain set of choices.  Obviously addictiveness isn’t the only feature of these platforms. They’ve empowered so many voices.  I’d just love to live in a world where our most influential technology didn’t measure its success by the time it took from us.


I thought I could resist the rat race.  I thought: ‘I’m a unique guy.  I like to mix things up.’  So I fought it for a long time.  I stayed up past my bedtime.  I listened to music really loud in the morning.  I rode my bike to work.  I always tried to find new places for lunch.  I joined a softball team.  I went to concerts on weeknights.  But I just got tired.  I ended up staying later at the office.  And I fell into a rhythm: come home, watch TV, and go to sleep.  I’m not sure I can do this for the next forty years.  I just miss waking up and not knowing what’s going to happen.  It’s never explicitly said to you that you need to live on your own, and have a good life, and meet someone, and have kids, and have those kids be more successful than you are.  But you feel the pressure all the time.  You feel it every time someone asks how your job is going.  Right now everyone in this park is taking a break from the thing they have to get back to.  It’s comforting in a way.  There’s a sense of solidarity in it.  We’re all feeling the same obligation.
My grandmother was the first in our family to discover it.  One day she joined a meditation in the park.  She was taking so many medications at the time, but she threw them all away and never took another trip to the hospital.  That was before the crackdown.  At one time were one hundred million followers of Falun Gong in China.  It’s a peaceful religion.  But the following grew too big.  Our teacher seemed like a threat to the government.  They said crazy things on state media.  They called it a cult.  They said we’re terrorists and that we kill our parents.  They began to arrest us.  They even harvested our organs.  I know it sounds crazy, but you can Google it.  We tried to resist.  We practiced inside our home.  We secretly handed out fliers to push back against the propaganda.  But they caught me on camera.  Everywhere there are cameras.  They followed me to my home.  They shoved me in their car.  For eight months I was in detention.  The first thing they did was take a sample of my blood.  For hours every day they put us in a room and forced us to watch television about how to be a good citizen.  If anyone looked away, the whole group was punished.  Eventually my family bribed the court with huge money and they let me go.  But for three years I had to write a letter every month saying that I am a guilty person.  When my probation ended, I left the country.


I never thought I’d come back to New York.  I have a lot of bad memories here.  It can be an ugly place.  My ex-husband lives here.  On September 11th I was on the street below the second tower.  So there are things I’d just prefer not to remember.  But recently my mother got sick and I came home to take care of her. I was in a bit of a rut at the time.  I’d fallen away from my passions.  I was just working to pay the rent.  And one evening I was walking by the river and I passed a place called Hudson River Community Sailing.  They offered free sailing lessons.  I don’t know why I stopped.  I was intellectually convinced that sailing was not for me.  I was getting older.  I was out of shape.  But I decided to give it a try.  And I got hooked on it.  I got kinda obsessed with learning to sail.  I remember the first time I was out there alone.  It felt amazing.  I was in the middle of the Hudson, the wind was blowing, I could see the whole city, and my hand was on the tiller.  It seemed like I was doing something impossible.  I’m not white.  I’m not male.  I don’t own a boat.  I don’t even have money.  But I’m in New York City and I’m fucking sailing.


The vibe was in the air.  You know it.  Kids know.  I wasn’t welcome or wanted.  My mom felt trapped.  She didn’t want her husband and she didn’t want kids.  She viewed me as a problem.  Everything that went wrong was my fault.  There was never a ‘How was your day?’ or ‘I love you.’  I wouldn’t even call it a childhood.  I never had a chance to be a kid.  So I started having sex very young.  I was only twelve but I was looking for it.  I met him in the men’s room of a movie theater.  He was a drifter.  I never felt hurt, or forced, or manipulated.  He never lured me with candy.  I didn’t even know the word ‘pedophile’ existed.  I was just thankful for the closeness.  I visited him on the weekends.  There wasn’t much conversation.  He never asked me about my week.  He never asked me about school.  What can I say?  It was what it was.  It wasn’t right or wrong to me.  It was a comfort.


When I came here I was alone.  I was sixteen and didn’t speak any English.  I remember on the first day of school, some guy was making fun of my younger brother and I punched him.  A few guys saw what was happening and ran down the hall to help.  They backed me up.  And afterward, they said: ‘We want you to join our group.’  So I started hanging out with them.  There were a lot of parties and girls.  It wasn’t bad at first.  A few times they asked me to punch someone in the mouth.  But the farther I got in, the crazier shit got.  I started using rocks and bats on people.  I just followed orders and never asked questions.  Then one day they asked me to attack a guy from our gang.  He was one of us.  And they wouldn’t even tell me why.  I realized that if they’d do it to him, they’d do it to me too.  So I left.  Whenever I see kids in the street now, I try to tell them: ‘Go back home.  Listen to your family.  Cause if anything happens— if you end up in the hospital or in jail, nobody from your gang will visit you.  And if you get killed, they won’t be the ones crying.


After the divorce I threw myself into work.  I’m in residency to be a psychiatrist, and I found that I could forget my problems if I focused on my patients.  But I’d come home feeling numb.  I wouldn’t sleep well.  I lost fifty pounds.  I kept convincing myself I was fine because I was still being so productive.  But when I started having thoughts of suicide, I knew I’d reached my tipping point.  I confided to my program director that I was going through a major depressive episode.  She supported me 100% and referred me to the psychiatrist I see today.  When I’m ready to get my license, there will be a question on the application that says: ‘Have you ever had a mental illness that impaired your ability to treat patients?’  I’m going to answer ‘no.’  Because being a patient has been a revelatory experience.  It’s taught me how difficult it can be to verbalize what you’re feeling.  And it’s taught me the power of denial, even for someone who studies the symptoms.  When I began the medication it was like a veil had been lifted from my eyes.  So much of what I know about depression, I learned by getting through it.




When it starts to get crowded, I’ll leave.  Because I can’t stand the looks.  You know how many people were gonna sit on that bench over there, but decided against it, because of what’s sitting right here?  I drank myself into homelessness.  So I’m not looking for violins or tissues.  But I used to be in the mainstream.  I was somebody once, and people used to look at me without any barriers or animosity.  I can tell you this: when John Lennon sings ‘Imagine,’ it’s complete bullshit.  He was living in the Dakota when he wrote that, overlooking Central Park.  Imagine no possessions?  He should have written a song about all the wonderful things that he had.  Imagine nothing to live or die for?  No Yoko?  No career?  No child?  No fame?  No status?  Well here I am.  There’s no peace here.


My parents are from the same small village in Mexico.  My mother was the daughter of a successful farmer.  My father was very poor.  Supposedly they never spoke to each other.  My father says he would sit on a rock and admire her from far away.  She lived in a big house.  She could barely leave because her father was very strict.  So they came to America for two different reasons.  My father came for work and my mother came for excitement.  They both ended up in New York, working at a small Mexican restaurant in Harlem.  My grandmother always laughs at my mother.  She says: ‘You ran all the way to America to marry a boy from the village.’


We had five kids together, but she’s a Gemini so she’s two faced.  She bought me a Greyhound ticket and sent me away.  Never told me why.  Could have been the not working.  Could have been the weed smoking.  But the worst part is that she threw me on child support.  Now I’ve got a $100,000 lien on my name.  It comes off the top of my check.  I could work all week and bring home $40.  So I’m better off not working.  It’s bullshit.  The government wasn’t in bed when I was fucking her.  Now they want to control me.  I don’t believe in their laws.  I follow natural law.  The Law of the Ancients.  I just have to find a way to disconnect from this social security number.


The second I started it was off to the races.  I was twelve or thirteen.  It’s the age you begin to realize that there’s some sort of norm.  You notice there’s a fellowship of people who can engage with each other, and these people tend to act or dress a certain way.  I yearned for social interactions.  I’d spend hours replaying certain situations, trying to figure out what to say or do differently.  I hated what I saw in the mirror.  And it didn’t help that I was a middle schooler in the closet.  I think the downers slowed me down to a train of thought I could handle.  They made me less inward focused.  I stole the alcohol from my parents.  And I’d sell shit from the house for the weed and pills, or coke, or even crack.  My parents couldn’t trust me for five minutes.  They put a pool alarm on my door.  Then they took the door off completely.  I told myself they were controlling and delusional, until finally I broke down crying and asked for help.  Next month will be three years sober.  In the program we have a saying: ‘If you follow the rules, you’ll get a life beyond your wildest dreams.’  It sounds a little ‘culty’ but it’s true.  Of course my wildest dreams weren’t the highest hopes.  I just wanted the ability to interact with people.  And I wanted people who care about me.  Now I have both, and it’s a beautiful thing.


The first thing I noticed was a tremor.  I’m a computer programmer and I kept accidentally hitting the shift key.  Then I started to lose my sense of smell. And finally came the depression.  My wife made me see a doctor.  She said to me: ‘Either you get on an antidepressant, or I’m going to.’  That's when I learned I had Parkinson's.  Over the years my tremors got worse.  My voice got quieter.  I had to quit working.  My dopamine levels fell so low that I lost communication between my brain and face.  I couldn't express any emotion.  My daughter grew up without seeing me smile.  I probably seemed distant.  A lot of times I felt like I couldn't fit in with the rest of the family.  Then a few months ago I had an experimental surgery.  They inserted a wire in my head that stimulates the brain with electricity.  Now all my emotions are coming back.  I’m more talkative.  I have more energy.  I’ve cried more in the last few months than I have in the past thirty years.  And for the first time in her entire life, my daughter can finally see me smile.


I got assaulted in the swimming pool this morning.  I was in the middle lane, like always.  It’s my lane.  And this woman swims right at me while I’m making my turn.  Physical contact.  I didn’t handle that well, because I’m a Libra.  I took it to another level.  I kicked my pace into second gear.  Next thing you know, she’s right on top of me, pushing me out of the lane.  I had to get management involved.  It ruined my morning.  I even cancelled my trip to the beach.  But then I went to yoga and calmed down for a hot minute.  And now I’ve invented another activity.  I went to the Whole Foods’ salad bar and created my own appetizer: Brown Rice Gluten Free Brown Chip Tapenade.  So I still got my fun in.


I’m a year out from breast cancer.  They caught it early but it still required two surgeries and radiation.  My body took a long time to heal and I lost all my stamina.  Before the diagnosis, I was running half-marathons.  I was kickboxing and lifting weights every day.  But the treatment really wiped me out.  And it was really tough for me because I’ve always been such an active person.  Exercise is how I lift my spirit.  But it got to the point where I could barely walk twenty minutes on a treadmill.  There were days I thought I’d never be my old self again.  But I’m starting to get my health back on.  I’m at about 75 percent now.  I’m lifting heavier weights.  I’m starting to feel strong.  I even signed up for an obstacle race next Saturday.  There are 27 obstacles, and I’m going to do as many of them as I can.  I’m getting back to my glory days.  Actually I’m going further than that.  I’m going to 120%.


I’d always play stickball in the streets, but my mother took me to see my first real baseball game in 1952.  It was the Brooklyn Dodgers: Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese, Duke Snider.  I’d seen them all on television, but it was a strange feeling actually being there.  The ballpark was a bigger than I thought.  The crowd was louder than I thought.  I was hooked.  I’ve been to over one hundred games since then.  I’ve been to Cooperstown five different times.  I don’t get to the ballpark much anymore, but I listen to every Yankee game on the radio.  I like to listen outside.  I’ll pick a different spot each time.  Sometimes I sit down by the river.  Once I went to Coney Island.  I pick my bench based on where the wind is blowing.  Occasionally people from church will walk by.  All my family has gone or moved away.  It does get lonely sometimes, mainly when I’m inside.  But never when I’m listening to the ballgame.


I’ve worked as a doula for over twenty years.  I’ve attended over 400 births.  My job is primarily to support the mother.  And I try to bring a spiritual element into what can seem like a clinical experience.  I never speak the language of the clinician.  Because if you can change the language, you can change the energy.  Birth is a mystery initiation.  It’s the transition between spiritual consciousness and earthly consciousness.  I tell the mother to ignore the machines.  Ignore the beeping and the charts.  Technology can seem sexy but it’s really a bullshit representation of what’s going on.  Nothing is broken and nothing needs fixing, because birth is not pathology.  It’s a beautiful design that’s worked since the beginning of time.  So just tune into your baby who is a sentient, conscious being, and do this thing together.


I got divorced when my daughter was very young.  So she’s kinda been my whole life since she was five.  It’s just the two of us.  I go to work, I come home, and she’s always there, maybe a little less now because she’s eighteen, but you know what I mean.  She’s about to leave for college in Chicago.  And it’s a little scary to send her off into the big world.  But she’ll be finding her tribe.  She’ll be learning about herself.  I’m excited for her. And I’m excited for me, too.  Because I think we both have a much bigger world ahead of us.  I’ve been holding myself back a little bit.  I’ve always wanted my daughter to know she’s my first priority, and that’s become a bit of an excuse.  An excuse not to travel.  An excuse to be overly selective in my relationships.  An excuse to not pursue new opportunities. For the longest time, if I said ‘no,’ it meant I was being a good mother.  But now if I say ‘no,’ it means I lack courage.


It’s basically the newborn stage forever.  He has both epilepsy and a very rare genetic disorder.  He can’t feed himself.  He’s not toilet trained.  He can’t speak.  He can’t tell us if he’s sad, or grumpy, or hungry.  He’s had more doctor appointments than both of us combined in our entire life.  We’re actually heading to a neurologist appointment right now.  The most difficult thing is finding peace and serenity.  Every time he has a seizure, I’m afraid it will be fatal.  People with his disorder don’t live very long.  But the disorder also makes him very happy.  So he’s oblivious and enjoying the world.  But I’ve been traumatized.  My husband is so supportive but a lot of days I feel completely alone.  There have been times when I’ve filmed myself on my phone just to have someone to talk to.  But every day I can choose to not be overwhelmed by my anxiety and fear.  Instead of curling up to cry, I can choose to meet him with joy where he’s at.  I felt loved by God when he was born.  I was working as a special education teacher, so I thought that God had given me a perfect fit.  We named him Iman Yageen, which means ‘faith without doubt.’   That name has become a reminder to me.  I say it all day long when I’m trying to get his attention.  And it reminds me that one day I’m going to hear him speak.  If not here, then in heaven.


Too many people are faking the funk.  I was at the club the other night.  And I’m scrolling through my Instagram and I see a post from a girl I know.  And she’s at the same club.  And in this photo she’s holding up a bottle, acting crazy, looking like she doesn’t have a care in the world.  But the club wasn’t even rocking like that.  It was a Thursday.  So I look across the room and there she is: sitting down, looking bored, scrolling through her phone, and clearly faking the funk.


I’d been putting it off because I didn’t have the money or time.  But a program at the VA offered to help with tuition, so I enrolled in Empire State College.  I wasn’t there to play.  I wasn’t there to party.  My only goal was to get an education. And more than the degree, I discovered that I needed the people.  I met people at college that I could bounce ideas off.  People who could challenge me to go further with my interests.  Two of my mentors were Dr. Fullard and Professor Whiteside.  Both of them had retired from corrections so they had a passion for helping black males.  They’d tell me: I notice you have a strong ability for ‘such and such,’ and I’d love to see you develop it further.  So that’s what I did.  Even though I majored in business, I found myself learning all about history and economics.  Right now I’m reading a book about the Haitian Revolution.  It has nothing to do with my major, but it’s important to me.  It’s part of my personal curriculum.  And that’s the most important thing that I got from college.  I got a degree.  But more importantly I developed a personal curriculum that I’ll be using for the rest of my life.


I’ve lived here my whole life.  I’m ready to leave.  I just graduated college and I’d love to experience a new city.  But I’m stuck.  My dad is trying to become a citizen, and I need to stay in the city because I’m the one petitioning on his behalf.  We’ve been waiting for five years already.  We’ve spent so much money.  But it’s the least I can do for him.  I’ve seen where he lived in Mexico: tiny houses, dirt floors, no shoes.  He was the youngest of twelve.  His family couldn’t afford to educate him.  So he came here when he was seventeen and worked as a migrant worker in California.  He slept in train cars and ate food out of the trash.  Even now he works fourteen hours a day.  He comes home, we talk a bit, and he goes to sleep.  It’s been that way my entire life.  He’s turning fifty soon and he’d love to start his own business.  So I hope he gets his citizenship.  It’s a little dangerous because he’s on the radar now.  They have his fingerprints.  But he’s got a son that fought in Afghanistan.  And now he’s got a daughter that graduated from NYU, so I think he deserves to stay.


I danced with him for ten years before I knew his name.


When I was younger I fell in love with a black man, which my mother didn’t like.  She tried to tell me that it would cause my grandmother to die of a heart attack.  But we married anyway.  And after having two children we got divorced.  My mother especially didn’t like that.  She was appalled.  She didn’t believe in divorce.  She told me that I couldn’t possibly love my children.  Our relationship never got better.  Over the years we’d have a weekly phone call.  We’d reenact the same conversations again and again.  I wanted her to acknowledge that I’d lived an interesting life.  It made me angry that she saw me as deficient.  I wanted her to see that my life had meaning, even if I was on my own.  She’s 89 now.  Two years ago she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, which has made her even blunter with her opinions.  She now openly expresses her preference for my brother.  It’s becoming clear that she won't change her mind about me.  And it carries a sting.  Because I guess we never stop hoping to be understood.


I’m much younger than I thought I would be.  When I was in college, I thought 43 seemed so old.  It just seemed everything would be set by then and my life would be over.  I thought I’d only be doing things that I had to do.  Everything is a choice when you’re young.  But then you graduate from school and make your big decisions: your career, your marriage, your kids. And it seems that with each big decision, you have less opportunity for choice.  But I still have a lot of choices.  It’s just not all about me anymore.  I enjoy choosing ways for my kids to experience new things.  I’m thinking about bringing them to the Ben and Jerry’s factory in Vermont next weekend.  I think they’ll get a kick out of it.  I can still remember my daughter’s face the first time she saw Yankee Stadium.  I’d already been dozens of times, but it almost felt like the first time for me too.  And I love taking my son to his soccer games.  He’s only six so he has no clue how to play.   But he’s decided that his job is to run back and forth in front of the goal.  He basically invented defense and I got to watch it happen.  These things are a lot of fun for me.  When I was young, I imagined they’d feel like obligations.  But they’re not.  They’re choices.


It’s so hard to ask for help.  Because you’re supposed to be ‘Mommy.’  And you never want to say: ‘I need help being Mommy.’  I carried this person for nine months.  I knew she was coming.  I felt like I should be able to handle it and I didn’t want to ask other people to stop their lives.  Especially if they had no part in making this baby.  But eventually I had to give in.  I’m just one person and being ‘Mama’ 24/7 can make you crazy.  I found myself getting frustrated that other people were going on with their lives.  I’d let things fester.  And it was unhealthy for my relationships.  I’d get heated with my mother and boyfriend.  Instead of beginning with ‘Can you help?’  I’d lose my temper, and jump straight to: ‘Why aren’t you helping?’


Recently I went home to Dublin for six months to spend time with my father.  He’s in the late stages of Alzheimer’s.  While I was there, I noticed that the bank where I worked was moving along fine without me.  It made me realize that my contribution was dispensable.  So when the sabbatical ended, I just couldn’t go back.  My friend happened to approach me around that time with an opportunity to start a company.  We’re developing an app to help manage the construction process.  It feels good to be learning so much again.  Everything was so specialized at the bank.  There was an expert for everything.  Everyone just stuck to the things they were good at and recognized for.  But there’s no bureaucracy in our start-up.  It’s just the two of us.  There’s only what needs to be done.  I can last about a year before things get financially stressful.  I’m hoping that the company will be viable by then.  Because even if it doesn't make a lot of money, as long as it survives, I’ll have been a part of creating something.


I wasn’t planning on dressing up as a clown.  I’d been drinking all night in Poughkeepsie and I somehow ended up at the train station, so I decided to take the 4 AM train into the city.  I had $200 in my pocket from some gutter cleaning work.  I immediately spent the first $60 on brunch and Bloody Marys.  Then I walked by Party City and I had the idea to get a clown wig.  But then I noticed the suspenders, and the top, and the bow tie, and some balloons.  I bought a red nose too but I’m not sure what happened to it.  I left the store with about $100, which was enough to get some shoes and a half pint of Seagram’s.  I ended the day with $10, but that got lost when I passed out in Times Square.  Now I'm trying to figure out how to get home.  I need to stop drinking.


I’ve known her since I was seven.  I had a crush on her even back then.  But she lived back in the Dominican Republic, so I’d only get to see her during the summer.  We just got tired of being apart.  So I asked her to marry me.  My parents were against it.  I was twenty-one.  I was going to City College.  I was still living at home and they thought I wasn’t ready.  And there was definitely some truth to that.  I had to drop out of school once she moved in with us.  I couldn’t handle everything.  At first I was depressed but I started to progress quickly at work.  I got raise after raise.  We moved out of my parents’ house and got a small apartment in the Bronx.  Now I’m studying to get my electrical license.  I've seen a lot of the guys I work with start their own companies.  You’ve just got to want it.  You’ve got to want to move up, and you can find a way.  The marriage has been great and it’s been tough.  We have a two-year-old daughter now.  It’s a lot of work.  But it’s also awesome to go home everyday and find two people who love me.


I’m trying to finish writing a book.  I’m on my fourth draft and have 70,000 words so far.  It’s an adventure tale set in Jamaica.  My main character is a twelve-year old girl named Kristi.  She’s the same age that I was when I left the island.  I really want to write something that resonates back home.  I’ve been researching the history and folklore of the country.  I’m trying to get the dialect just right.  I want Jamaicans to recognize themselves and be proud.  I've been working on it for four years now.  I’ve given up on so many other things.  I gave up on being a doctor.  I’ve given up writing other stories.  I lost sixty pounds last year, but before that I’d given up on so many diets.  So I’m determined to finish this.  I try not to think about other goals for the book.  Because the more I need from it, the more I freeze up.  I have a lot of debt.  I have a lot of relatives in Jamaica that need money.  But if I start writing to feel hopeful about my financial situation, the words won’t come.  So my goal is just to finish my fourth draft.  And if that happens, my next goal is to get a rejection letter that tells me something I can improve.


A few years ago I get a call from my wife, and she tells me that her aunt is going through a tough time and needs a place to stay.  So I agreed to let the aunt stay with us for a few months.  ‘I’m doing a good deed,’ I thought.  But things got weird after she moved in.  She was a really quiet lady.  And she always seemed to be watching me.  I’d be walking around downstairs, and I’d notice the aunt peering down on me from the upper level.  Like I was some sort of intruder.  But I think to myself: ‘Just ignore it.  She’s going through a rough time.’  Then one night I wake up at 2:30 AM and the aunt is standing over my bed, saying some sort of prayer over me.  And I sleep completely naked.  And I have no idea how long this woman has been there.  And I wake up my wife, who starts dragging the aunt out of the room, and the whole time the woman is screaming at me: ‘I know who you are!  You aren’t fooling anyone!’  It was terrifying.  My wife and I separated four months later.  Things hadn’t been going great, but that aunt definitely flushed the toilet.


I haven’t worked with an American for three years.  I’m a union drywall finisher, and my job has completely been taken over by Central and South Americans.  All of them have union cards now.  Can you imagine being the only one on your crew who doesn’t speak Spanish?  There’s nobody to talk to.  You have no clue what people are saying.  It’s isolating.  And all of them stick together too.  My last three foremen were from El Salvador, Paraguay, and Peru.  And whenever work dries up, I’m the first one trimmed from the crew.  Always.  No matter how hard I work.  I used to get angry about it.  It felt like I’d been sold out by the mayor and the union bosses.  I even started having racist thoughts.  But that’s not me, man.  I know they aren’t bad people.  They’re just sticking together like any of us would.  How can you blame them?  My parents were immigrants.  I grew up in New York.  I’ve got friends from all over the world.  So I’m not going to start thinking like that.  I’m not going there.  That’s not who I am.


We’re going to a new school for kindergarten.  They make you wear green clothes and there are fishy games with fish that eat numbers.  We’re going to be in different classes.  We’re not sure what that’s going to be like.  But we’re only a little scared, because we can see each other at lunch and recess.


I had to take a bike ride to get away from my teenage daughter.  She missed the deadline for her college application, but she lied and told me that she’d sent it in on time.  I believed her.  I decided to give her space and let her do it on her own.  Then yesterday I found a letter saying that her application came too late.  So I cooked her dinner.  I let her have a nice meal.  Then I served her the letter for dessert.  We started arguing.  She told me that she wants to take a semester off.  She thinks I’m bossing her around and she wants to do things her own way.  But I worked two jobs for this girl.  I raised her on my own.   I’ve given her everything.  She was born at 11:58 PM, two minutes before my birthday.  She looks just like me.  She acts just like me.  And she’s stubborn like me.  Whenever we butt heads I think, ‘Oh my God.  I’m Angie.  I’m fighting with my eighteen-year-old self.’ Except I was already pregnant with her older brother by then.  And I just want things to be easier for her.


I’ve been crocheting since I was 15.  I started out with patterns from the magazines but there was one point where I just said ‘screw this’ and started designing everything myself.  I’ve got twelve giant tubs of yarn at home.  Everything I make is one of a kind, even if it’s a shawl.  My shawl is going to have a slightly different color or slightly different stitch than any other shawl.  I’ve crocheted hundreds of Christmas presents.  I crocheted the sweater I’m wearing.  I even helped crochet a sweater for a huge water tower.  My section alone took three weeks.  The theme of the Crochet Guild convention last year was ‘under the sea,’ so I knitted 110 sea horse pins.  And right now I’m working on a mermaid tail for the daughter of the niece of my brother-in-law.
I started my career as a teller at a community bank in Florida.  I was in my early thirties.  At the time I had a young child and I just needed a way to pay my rent and car payment.  But I kept moving up.  I wouldn’t say I’m overly ambitious.  It didn’t come from a place of ‘I need more.’  I just have a lot of energy.  And I’d always ask the next question or apply for the next job.  So I worked my way up to CEO.  It was demanding but I enjoyed the position.  I was handling it quite well until a few years ago when my husband passed away.  Then my mother.  And then my best friend.  All of this happened in a single year.  I’d never even lived alone before.  Suddenly I felt unanchored.  I reached this place of ‘what do I do now?’  I couldn’t go back to making more money.  So I decided to make a change.  I went back to college to get a Master of Public Administration.  And right now I’m actually on the lunch hour for my final class.  I’ve already got a job waiting on me back home.  I’m the new Director of Broward County's Business Council on Homelessness.  We’re working toward getting homeless people into permanent housing.  And I’m really excited.  I want to do a great job.  I’m in a place where I can change some lives.  It feels like I've moved from success to significance.
I love walking around the city.  I catch the Metro North train at 11:40 every morning. I go to the same gym that I’ve been going to for forty years.  Then I just start walking.  If you take big strides it really stretches you out.  And there are millions of other people walking around.  You never feel alone.  People smile at you.  On weekends I’ll bring my granddaughters with me and we’ll tour different neighborhoods.  We’ve seen ten or twelve so far.  Sometimes I get to borrow them for the whole afternoon.  But they’re at sleep away camp right now so I’m missing them a lot.  And that’s about it.  I do a little shopping at the thrift store.  I stop and read the paper.  I eat at outdoor restaurants.  It’s simple but I found what makes me happy and I’m doing it.  And when I’m heading home at night, sometimes I think: ‘I just had the best day of my life.’
I’m a single father raising a teenager.  We’re meeting here in a few minutes to go on a run.  I’m trying to teach him discipline and focus.  He’s had some problems paying attention in school, but I don’t want to put him on medication.  His mother and I divorced when he was four.  She’s a good person.  She’s very appreciative of what I’ve done.  She just wasn’t ready to be a parent.  I was in a much better place.  So she didn’t fight me on custody.  But it scares me to think if she had.  The courts are set up against men.  They almost always determine that women should raise kids and men should pay child support.  I don’t understand it.  There’s a big push to see women as equal workers.  Why can't men be equal parents?"
I took him to see Brokeback Mountain when it came out.  I thought I was challenging him with the choice.  But at the end of the film, he turned to me and said: ‘That’s me.’  We’d been married for thirty years.  Our kids were still young.  I didn’t know what to do.  Do I leave?  Do I stay?  We were ex-pats in another country at the time, so we were all alone.  I had nobody to talk to.  We went to a therapist to see if it was possible to stay together, and she told us: ‘I’ve seen it work.  But only if one person is very discrete and the other is very tolerant.’  So I agreed to try.  It’s been ten years.  It’s been exhausting in a lot of ways.  I asked too many questions at first.  I made myself miserable.  Now I give him a lot of space.  And I get a lot of space in return.  I’ve been traveling alone for about two months now.  I know what’s going on back home but I don’t ask about it.  My friends ask me why I don’t move on with my life.  I don’t know the answer.  Maybe I’m just too afraid to be alone at this age.  But I still feel like he’s my soul mate.  We have the same view of the world.  We both love children.  We love traveling and good food.  He really is a good man.  He’s just gay.  And we’ve had such a good life together, I’m just not ready to stop sharing it.
So one day I’m sitting here talking to this lady, and I’m eating a sandwich.  And the lady says to me: ‘There’s a sparrow sitting on your sandwich.’  And I think, ‘Wow.  That’s pretty thrilling.’  So I began to feed it.  And that sparrow started spreading the word, and I developed a bit of a reputation in the sparrow community.  And suddenly I become the sparrow guy.  There’s like sixty of them waiting for me every morning.  All these benches are covered in shit.
My superpower is fire.  It’s inside my hands but I only use it on bullies.  My dad is a superhero too.  His power is minding his own business.
My wife and I were in our late thirties when we met.  Kids just weren’t in the cards for us.  I always thought I would have been a good dad, but time just went by and it never happened.  So we raised a little family of dachshunds instead.  We got Ozzie and Eva shortly after getting together.  They both lived for thirteen years.  Having two extra lives in the house was a wonderful thing.  They needed to be cared for.  They gave and received love.  I imagine that it’s a little like having a kid.  When Oscar passed away, I was so distraught that I passed out on the floor of the vet.  Eva lived for another year, and after she died, we decided to wait before adopting again.  We lasted about a year.  Pepper came from a high kill shelter in Los Angeles.  She was terrified for the first few weeks and wouldn’t come near us.  But she trusts us now.  She is definitely a Daddy’s girl.
My son is on the computer all the time.  He’ll start as soon as he gets home from school and goes until bedtime.  It’s some sort of adventure game involving teamwork.  He wears a headset and plays with his friends.  His goal was to go outside more this summer but that hasn’t happened.  Maybe I enabled him.  I held off on getting him a phone and computer, but at some point every other kid has got one.  And you don’t want him to fall behind with technology.  He’s a good kid.  His grades are pretty good.  His teachers love him.  He’s very polite.  He helps his mother.  I just wish he’d apply his interest in games to other things.  He was in science club, but he quit that.  He took some Tae Kwon Do lessons, but he quit that.  I thought maybe coding classes would interest him because he loves being on the computer, but that didn’t work either.  I also played video games as a kid.  But we’d just beat a few levels of Mario, and then we’d get a call to come outside.  But that doesn’t happen anymore.  Because the person who’d normally call you is on the other end of the headset.
I’ve been on antidepressants since August of last year.  I was living alone in the city at the time and feeling a lot of anxiety.  So I talked to a therapist, and she recommended antidepressants.  At first I was nervous about taking them.  There’s a bit of a stigma in the African American community.  If you take any sort of medication, it’s like: ‘Oh, you crazy now.’  So the first thing I did was look on the Internet.  I’m not even sure what I searched.  But somehow I ended up finding Matt’s videos on YouTube.  He was sort of documenting his own experience with antidepressants.  He was black.  He was male.  He was queer.  And he was doing fine.  It just made me feel a lot less alone.  I sent him a short message thanking him for his videos, and he started checking in on me about once a week.  He’s been a great friend.  We actually just met in person for the first time on Saturday.
My father called me ‘stupid’ a lot.  Even when I’d bring home good grades, he’d say things like: ‘You’re smart, but you don’t know anything.’  I just wasn’t a big reader like him.  He always had a book in his hand.  Math was my thing.  During lunch I’d go to the junior high library and sit on the floor with puzzle books.  Now I’m a teacher, and I’ve taught every math class in the high school curriculum.  A few years ago I was teaching my precalculus class, and I stumbled upon a set of numbers that generated ellipses with identical positioning in both the rectangular and polar coordinate systems.  So I turned them into variables, wrote a two-page proof, and had my work published in a journal called The Mathematics Teacher.  Take that, Dad.
My mom left the Philippines when I was five years old.  My sisters and I were very young at the time.  We basically raised ourselves because my dad doesn’t talk much.  It must have been hard on my mother.  She wasn’t able to come back because of her visa status, and we didn’t have the money to visit.  We talked on the phone about once a month.  She’d send us letters, and clothes, and toys.   It took ten years of working and saving for her to finally bring us over.  I think the reunion was much different than she imagined.  She probably expected us to be grateful, but all of us were teenagers by then.  We weren’t used to being told what to do.  So we were pretty awful to her.  And my father divorced her soon after we arrived in America.  But her sacrifice paid off.  We all graduated college and have good jobs.  But it wasn’t until I became an adult that I realized how lonely those ten years must have been.
Today in microfashion
My dad came here when he was my age, but I don’t feel especially connected to Vietnam.  I haven’t even really asked him about his history.  I’m a proud person.  But for me it’s about what I’m doing right now.  I didn’t experience my father’s history.  So I’d rather not identify as the son of a refugee.  I’m an American kid going to an American school. I’d much rather see myself as an adjective.  Preferably one that refers to my personality.  Like ‘cool.’  Or ‘nice.’  Or ‘interesting.’
Last year I did an exploration of having a child on my own.  I went to the doctor, and after she looked at my uterus, she said: ‘Not only is it possible, but your uterus looks younger than its years.’  Then she put me in the stirrups and did a demo to show me exactly how the procedure would work.  The ultrasound screen was right next to me.  I kept looking at it and wishing I could see a baby on there.  But I was already 48.  I was single.  My income wasn’t secure at the time.  And I didn’t have family that could take care of the child if something happened to me.  So I decided not to do it.  I finally closed the door for good.  I cried uncontrollably for weeks.  It’s a gaping hole in my life that will never go away.  I’ll just get better at dealing with it.  I wish I’d done it on my own when I was younger.  I wish I’d stopped complaining about the past, and hoping for the future, and just said: ‘Fuck it. This is where I am now, and this is what I can do about it.’
Last week I was picking through the trash, looking for bottles and cans to recycle, and my social worker walked by with her family.  She walked just a few feet from me.  And I know she saw me.  But she didn’t say a thing.  Not even ‘hello.’  I asked her about it during our next meeting, and at first she denied seeing me.  But then she told me that she had been in her ‘private space.’  That really put a stake in my heart.  Why can’t you say ‘hello’ to me in your private space?  So I’m writing her a letter.  I’m using a dictionary because I want the words to be perfect.  If you mess up your words, then it’s easy for people to ignore what you’re trying to say.  And I want to be sure she knows exactly how it made me feel.
It happened on Father’s Day.  I took him out to lunch, and then afterward we went to a barbecue at his family’s house.  He’d been drinking all day.  At one point he’s got our daughter in his arms, and he tells her to call me a ‘biatch.’  So I start yelling at him.  And he hits me so hard with his fist that I had to get ten stitches.  That was the last straw for me.  I still think he’s a great dad.  I’ll give him that.  A lot of people ask me how I can say that, but I see it like this: when he’s around my daughter, I see the love.  She lights up when he walks in the room. I wanted that love for myself, but at least she gets it.  And he’s a good provider.  He works.  He just bought her a bunch of new clothes this weekend.  When he dropped them off at the house, he asked me if I was going to drop the charges.  I told him ‘no.’ Not this time.
I feel like I had so many more stories before I came to film school.  I wrote so much when I was young.  I’d fill up entire journals.  I was a quiet kid, so writing was my way of imagining conversations that I’d never have in real life.  But it doesn’t feel like I’m expressing myself anymore.  It’s become less about whether I like it, and more about whether my professors and classmates like it.  I’m always focused on the rhythm, or the structure, or the notes I received in class, or all these rules from a long time ago that everybody uses because they work.  And it just feels like I’m swapping out decorations in a house that’s already been built.  But I’m afraid to be more inventive, because if your work doesn’t fit the rules, then people will doubt your talent.  So film school has made me much better at making other people happy.  But it’s made me less happy.  And that’s not a direction that I can see myself continuing for very long.
My mother was sick for most of my life.  She had nineteen years of treatment for Hodgkin’s disease. But she was the kind of mother that would come home from chemotherapy, vomit in the bathroom, and then still cook dinner for all of us.  And she did this while getting a PhD in clinical psychology.  She just loved being a mother. Even after the chemotherapy destroyed her ovaries, she adopted two more children.  She passed away I was twenty-five.  Shortly after she died, I realized that I couldn’t remember her voice.  I’ve just never been an oral person.  It was maddening.  It felt almost disrespectful.  I had all these old videos of her, but they were silent.  So I thought I’d just never know what she sounded like.  Then last night, my sister found a small cassette in an old box.  It was from my mother’s answering machine.  And she picked up the phone during one of the recordings.  It was a month before she died.  She was so sick at the time.  But she said to the person: ‘Nicholas is coming to visit me, so I stayed up late baking, and I’m waking up early to clean.’
I was in a relationship for most of my teenage years.  He wasn’t a bad guy, but I think long relationships can be toxic when you’re that young.  That’s the age when you’re supposed to be figuring yourself out.  And that can be hard if you’re completely focused on another person.  I was always more worried about ‘us’ than I was worried about myself.  I’d make decisions just to maximize our time together: the places I worked, the classes I chose, the friends I spent time with.  Recently I looked through my high school photos, and I don’t have a single picture when I’m not with him.  And, I don’t know… it feels like some of those memories should have been mine alone.
I like to shop, but I hate going to those fancy stores in midtown. They treat me like I don’t have any money. They’re always telling me prices when I didn’t ask. Either that, or they figure I’m coming in to steal. I went to one store recently, and as soon as I walked in the door, I saw the manager lean in to the clerk and say, ‘Watch her.’ And so this girl starts following me around, real close. She was acting like she wanted to help. If I picked up an item, she’d say: ‘Let me hold onto that for you.’ So I thought to myself: ‘I’ll give you something to hold.’ I walked around that entire store. I went on a real spree. By the time we were finished, she was holding 25 dresses. You could barely see her face. Then I led her up to the cash register and said, ‘You know what? I changed my mind. I think I'll shop somewhere else.’
I came to it late in life.  I was already in college.  We were playing a dice game in the back of a bar and my character transformed into a lion.  I’ve been hooked ever since.  Now I’m part of a huge role-playing community, and next week I’m going to a three-day event in Pennsylvania.  Basically it’s a bunch of people getting together and pretending to be something we’re not.  It’s the bonding that’s most important.  The hobby is great, but you always spend more time talking then doing the hobby itself.  We’re building a shared history.  And each time we meet there’s more to reminisce about.  It can be hard to meet people when you’re older, but I’ve made hundreds of friends in the community.  When my dad got sick recently, I asked for ‘spells, prayers, and cat videos.’  The post had 111 comments and 94 emoticons.
Really incredible update for everyone who donated to our Rohingya fundraiser earlier this year.  Thanks to the hard work of Jerome Jarre and Love Army, our expectations have been wildly exceeded.  2500 homes have been built and the remainder should be finished by next month.  These houses were built by over 1500 *paid Rohingya volunteers.*  Not only were they built to specification, but extra features were added to each house.  Solar panels were added to every roof.  (In the words of Jerome: ‘These are high quality solar panels, not cheap ones that break in two weeks.’)  Lights and fans were installed.  A custom cooking stove and chimney were also added, along with additional shelves for storing food.  Thanks to Jerome’s obsession with controlling costs, these additional upgrades came in at just $70 per house, which Jerome funded from other sources.

Extremely thankful to Jerome and Love Army for being such good stewards.  The money could not have been spent more efficiently.  Jerome asked if I would mind sharing the fundraiser link again to help with routine maintenance of the houses.  So if any one wishes to help more, they can be assured that their donations are in the right hands:


It’s my reboot.  I have a level of confidence on the softball field that I somehow need to find in the rest of my life.  I’m like a puppy in the outfield.  I don’t have to think about what I’m doing.  You can hit the ball anywhere and I’ll track it down.  I love the moment when the ball is in the air, and I’m focusing on it, and I’m not thinking about anything else.  I’m not thinking about paying rent.  I’m not worrying about the next audition.  I’m not feeling the fear of being just a bartender.  It’s my moment of Zen.  I used to feel the same way when I was acting, or in front of a camera.  And I still do, when I get to do it.
At first it was absolutely shocking.  He’s up every two hours.  If all he does is grumble, there’s a good chance that he’ll fall back asleep.  But if he starts gobbling out vowels and consonants, that means he’s up for good and nobody’s going back to sleep for a while.  We’ve been getting some longer chunks of sleep lately.  But whenever we think it’s conquered, there’s a curveball.  So we’ve just had to embrace being absolutely knackered all the time.  The first thing to go was our vocabularies.  You know when you can’t quite think of a word, but then you suddenly get it?  Well that doesn’t happen anymore.  The word never comes.  So now we consider it a win if we’re able to communicate a rough idea of what we mean.
I’m writing a Grandma Noir.  The premise is this: a lady comes to an old person’s home, but nobody likes her.  Suddenly she turns up dead and our protagonist Helen has to solve the mystery. There’s a motorized wheelchair chase.  There’s a Viagra orgy.  There’s a villain who’s faking Alzheimer’s while masterminding a pill-trading operation.  It’s got everything.  I sent the book to a bunch of agents.  I got a nibble from one of them.  She told me that she made it to page 100 before quitting, so I figure I’m on the right track.
My dad helped me choose my clothes until I was six years old but then I wanted to do it myself.  He’s still my main fashion inspiration.  He actually brought me this scarf from India.  But he mainly likes to wear man shirts with words on them. At first I didn’t have a very good sense of style.  I just wore pink leggings with shorts over them.  I got better when I was nine or ten.  And now that I’m eleven, I think I’m finally figuring it out.
It was my decision to leave. There were too many problems. She hadn’t kissed me in years. We’d argue over every little thing. Our son was grown and I just didn’t see a reason to stay. So I came home from work one day, packed up my things, and left. I’ve been staying with my sister ever since. It’s been a tough two years. I’ve tried to reach out but she isn’t talking to me anymore. My son isn’t speaking to me either. They want nothing to do with me. I biked over here for Father’s Day. I was going to knock on their door but I changed my mind. I decided to just let them be. I wish I’d never left. Even though we were always fighting, it still felt like I had a home.
A couple weeks ago we were coming home from visiting my brother in Long Island and we stopped at a burger place off the highway.  He had a Junior Whopper.  I had a Whopper.  We split the fries.  And while we were eating, he said: ‘You know what Daddy?  You’re a really great Daddy.  I love you Daddy.’  And that got me.  I almost choked on my burger.  Because it wasn’t bedtime.  He wasn’t leaving for school.  It was just off the cuff.
Obama had been president for six days.  The old timers in the twelve-step program tell you to associate the memory with something, so that’s how I remember it.  The weather was just like this, even though it was November.  It was sixtyish degrees.  I was sitting on a stoop, having my morning beer and cigarette, and feeling disgusted with myself.  I was wheezing so bad that it felt like I’d swallowed a whistle.  And I had this moment of clarity.  I knew I was done.  So I took a couple more swigs, threw the pack of Newports into traffic, and walked over to Project Renewal on 3rd Street.  I’ll be ten years sober if I can make it until November 10th.  That was my day.  And it still is my day.  Even if I fail, I’ll remember that on that day I succeeded.  And if I did it then, I can do it again.
I was eleven when my mom divorced my stepdad.  She had four kids at the time.  I remember we were in the bedroom, and she said to me: ‘You’re the oldest so I’m going to need your help.’  And ever since then I’ve been ‘Mom Number Two.’  I picked my little brothers up from school.  I cooked for them.  I made sure they did their homework.  I met with their teachers.  I’d be the authority figure until mom came home from work.  I was always the responsible one.  Nobody ever had to worry about me.  But now I’m twenty and my whole life has been about my little brothers.  I’ve never really felt the security to figure myself out.  But today is orientation at my new college.  I just finished meeting with my advisor.  There are so many clubs and organizations that I can join.  I want to meet a lot of different people.  I want to be more outspoken.  I feel like this is my chance to learn who I am.
I was diagnosed with leukemia during my early teens.  It was a full year being out of school.  And when I came back it felt like everyone had moved on without me.  I had to repeat ninth grade.  My social circles had changed and I was desperate to make new friends.  I started trying way too hard to impress people.  I’d make stuff up about myself.  I remember pretending that I could read palms.  Anything to get close to people who were cooler than me.  But the worst part is that I started to avoid people who weren’t "cool.'  There was one girl I absolutely loved, but she had a weight problem and kids were mean to her.  So I started ducking into classrooms if I saw her coming down the hall.  Or I’d sit at the other end of the cafeteria.  It was the opposite of who I’d always been.  I’d always been the one making sure everyone was included.  I was always the first one to introduce myself to new kids.  I wanted everyone to feel important.  But for awhile I became the opposite of that.  I became a social climber.
I’m from a small country in Africa called Benin.  I won the visa lottery to come here.  I didn’t even know I was eligible.  My brother entered my name and didn’t even tell me.  I was studying to be a psychiatrist at the time.  I assumed that I’d be able to continue with medical school.  But when I arrived here, I found out that none of my credits would transfer.  I had a choice: either go home and become a doctor, or start from the bottom.  I didn’t speak any English.  I didn’t have any money.  But I knew if I could somehow make it here, my degree would be much more valuable.  So I made the choice to stay.  I began practicing English with my young nieces.  The first thing I learned was: ‘I’m going to kick you.’  I got a job with a catering company and learned how to say ‘I’m here to deliver your food.’  I studied as many YouTube videos as I could during my free time.  It’s been three years now.  I’m almost finished with my bachelor’s degree.  Just two classes left.  At nights I work as a behavioral specialist in a mental health facility.  I’m going to take the MCAT in September. My friends back home have all become doctors already, but I try not to think about them.  I don’t want to lose my focus.  I haven’t made it yet, but I’m making it.
I’ve known I wanted to be an actor ever since we performed Horton Hears A Who in 5th grade drama camp.  I studied theater in college.  But right now I’m in between roles.  It’s been a minute.  My acting teacher told us to just focus on the callbacks.  But getting callbacks is not getting a part.  The last role I had was a space pirate in a Star Warsy kind of play.  It was at an art gallery in Long Island City.  I was fighting an evil race of aliens on a zombified planet, but I’d actually been hit by a train and was in a simulation to keep my brain active.  It was every Halloween costume that I ever wanted to be, but I only made enough money to buy myself dinner.  Do I choose more stability and less joy?  Maybe I could find a job that has one element I enjoy, like Human Resources at Wells Fargo.  Overall it would suck but at least I’d get to help people.  Sure I’d spend six hours being upset, but at least I could help Jane with her issue.
He’s had problems with speech since he was two years old.  Even as a baby he would get frustrated when he couldn’t express himself.  He’d scream.  He’d clench his fists.  He still occasionally has trouble knowing what he wants.  Sometimes I can calm him down with words.  Other times it just makes things worse, and I’m better off doing nothing at all.  It’s a challenge every day.  It’s especially tough in public because it seems like you have no control.  You can feel people looking at you.  And you feel judged, judged, judged.  But every child is so different.  Nobody understands your situation.  And they don’t know your story.
I tell my students things that only the Master of The Universe could know.  I tell them that if they choose a certain path, they can be sure of success.  At times I’ve convinced them that certain assignments will make or break their future.  For a middle school to work, you have to impart a sense of urgency.  You have to make them believe these things.  Time may not be as important as we say it is, but it’s more important than they think it is.  I teach in one of the most underprivileged neighborhoods in the city.  And it’s almost too late to change their course when I get them.  By seventh grade, the engine is almost finished, and you’re just adding the windows and tires.
There was never any joy in it.  I practiced every day since I was four years old.  I was just afraid of what would happen if I stopped.  My father was a ‘rageaholic.’  Even our piano playing came from a place of hate.  He wanted to humiliate his colleagues and prove that his children were superior.  He was a hematologist.  He was respected in his field.  His only friends were his colleagues.  Occasionally he’d have them over to dinner.  Or more accurately, they’d invite him first and he’d feel the need to reciprocate.  Those dinners were an escape for my sister and me.  He’d never act out his worst stuff in front of other people.  I think the other doctors could sense something was wrong, but nobody ever pulled me aside.  It felt like I was trapped in a castle with an evil king and queen and nobody was allowed inside.  People did come in, of course.  But they would never meddle.  They were his guests and it’s not polite.
Fifth grade graduation is in two weeks.  I’m going to miss my teachers, lunch, recess, and my counselor Meghan.  She’s a kind-hearted person that doesn’t give up on you.  The first time I met Meghan was in third grade when I got really mad at one of my teachers who was being mean because of something called tenure.  I punched the wall so hard that I got scars on my knuckles.  I was sent to Meghan’s office and I talked to her for like two hours.  I told her about the whole first half of the year.  She didn’t even fidget when she was listening.  Now we meet once a week.  We always work on being empathetic.  Empathy was my big thing during fourth and fifth grade.
I was eating, sleeping, and shitting libraries.  My life was becoming a little one note.  All my friends were librarians.  My social life consisted of professional development conferences.  I needed another source of inspiration.  So I started writing comic book reviews online.  I built up a nice little portfolio.  One of my reviews was actually quoted on the back of a comic book.  Another one got copied and pasted into a marketing email.  They spelled my name wrong but it still felt great. I haven’t made any money yet, but you can’t put a price tag on this.  I’m writing all the time.  I’m engaging a part of brain that was being ignored.  Two years ago I just worked in library sales.  Now I’ve got a press pass to Comic Con.
When you’re a kid, Jesus sounds like a hippie or Bernie Sanders or something so it all sounds pretty nice. But then the rules get confusing. You go to Catholic school and some guy in a dress named Brother Roy starts beating you cause you got in a fight. It’s sorta like Gitmo in there. And you start to realize that all these rules are just to keep people down. To keep women down especially because they have the ultimate power of not fucking you. I do like the Jews because their version is less full of shit. A lot of those Talmud guys are so smart that they’re practically just atheists who love fairy tales. And Buddhism is pretty cool too cause it’s all in your head. No Pope. No mandatory meetings. Anyway, let me know if you figure it out. I don’t know shit I just dress well.
When I first moved here I was living with my uncle in Brooklyn.  He lives in a Jewish neighborhood.  I accidentally set off his alarm one night when I came home.  I couldn’t defuse it.  The alarm kept screaming: ‘Burglary!  Burglary!  Burglary!’  I was the only black person in the neighborhood at the time, so I panicked.  I knew it didn’t look good.  And I didn’t want to die in this movie.  So the first thing I did was call 911.  The operator was like ‘What’s your emergency?’  I told her: ‘I’m staying at my uncle’s house, and the alarm is going off, and I need you to tell the responding officer to expect a black man.’  And she said: ‘Is your uncle black too?’  And I said: ‘Ma'am, all of us are black.’  Then I fixed up a bowl of macaroni and cheese, turned on all the lights, stood in the middle of the living room, and waited for the knock.
I’d been smoking pot since ninth grade and it made me think differently.  So I figured that psychedelics would be the next step.  I’d just moved to California.  I was hearing stories of people tripping in nature.  At the minimum they were being inspired and at the maximum they were being enlightened.  It seemed like there was something more out there and I just wanted to get a glimpse of it. Mushrooms definitely give you a feeling of having ‘made it through.’  It’s like you’ve been sheltered from reality your entire life, and you’re finally seeing it, and it’s going to stay that way.  But I became obsessed with the chemical.  I was making all these beautiful connections.  And they seemed so real.  But in the end I was still alone in my head.  And I was becoming more isolated.  Some people find a lot of value in them, but my journey with psychedelics ended at the hospital.
I was not a tough kid growing up.  I was timid.  I was very sensitive to pain in other kids.  I never wanted to do anything that made people feel worse than they already did.  And God forbid I ever hurt somebody.  That would just destroy me.  I’m having to learn to dial that back as an adult.  There’s such a thing as being too compassionate.  If you’re too scared of causing pain, you can easily be manipulated.  Your fear becomes a button to be pushed.  In my last relationship, I was made to feel hurtful or aggressive whenever I stood up for myself.  So I always backed down.  I’ve got to learn the line between being compassionate and being a doormat.
I felt humiliated and suicidal in college.  It seemed like my personal failings were on display for everyone to see.  I’m not all that attractive.  I have a speech impediment.  I’m not good socially.  I saw other guys having romantic success and I felt a lot of envy.  I concluded that women owed me something.  They owed me a chance.  And I was angry they weren’t giving it to me.  I’m ashamed of it now, but during that time I formed a lot of bad and hateful opinions.  I joined ‘incel’ communities on 4chan and Reddit.  I found a lot of men there who felt just like me.  The community provided this pseudoscientific justification for hating women.  It let us feel like it wasn’t our fault.  We stoked each other’s anger.  And it felt good.  Honestly, anger is just very addictive.  You want to feel angry when you’re suffering.  It gives you adrenaline.  It gets your endorphins going.  It’s a release.  It’s a substitute for what you’re missing.
I turned fifty a couple weeks ago.  I’ve lived in the same neighborhood for most of my life, which makes it more challenging because everything around me has changed so dramatically.  My best friend and I got our first apartment here when we were twenty years old.  We used to play this game where we’d race each other through the streets.  We’d take off our shirts and run to the Hudson.  First one to get there was King Of The World.  There was a vibrancy back then.  People would see us running but they’d be OK with it.  Because we were young.  We were allowed to take up space.  You think you’ll act young forever but the rules change.  Your audience won’t allow it.  We’re programmed to see older people a certain way.  You can almost chart it on a graph.  You disappear as you age and the world notices you less and less.  And it makes you realize how much energy you got from being noticed.
It’s International Whores' Day today.  It’s about reclaiming the word.  ‘Whore’ is a hateful word.  There’s so much stigma in that word.  It can be used against any woman that you want to hurt.  It’s dehumanizing.  And it strips sex workers of dignity.  Construction workers get paid to use their bodies.  Factory workers get paid to use their bodies.  But if you use your genitals then suddenly you’re an outcast.  Sex workers are at the highest risk of sexualized violence.  And it’s funny that in this era where everyone is calling out workplace harassment, the most vulnerable group is being ignored.  They’re not seen as worthy of protection.  Language matters.  So we shouldn’t be calling people ‘whores.’  We should be calling them ‘people.’
I married when I was sixteen. It was an arranged marriage. I’d never seen him before. I just came home from school one day and my dad told me that someone is coming to see you. He said: ‘You’re going to get married.’ The man was twenty-nine. I was so upset. Nobody ever discussed it with me. I had wanted to finish my education. I had wanted to be a flight attendant. I fought so hard but the whole family turned against me. Everyone stopped talking to me. My father stopped eating. So I gave up. I married my husband and came to America. I had three kids by the time I was twenty. I’ve accepted it now. He’s a good father to my children. He tried to tell me what to do at first but he’s given up. I work at Starbucks and the bakery. They’re nice people. They treat me good. But one day I’d like to maybe have a higher position so that I can work just one job. So I can spend some time on myself. And so I can maybe finally go to school.
We had a Native American museum today in third grade and the whole school came.  I’ve been looking forward to it ever since second grade when I learned that third graders get to make dioramas.  The museum was open from 10:15 to 10:45 or something like that.  There was a cooking section where we gave out pumpkin bread.  Then there was a tools and artifacts section.  My table was in the games section.  I put my snow snake on display.  Snow snake is a very fun game in my opinion, but only four people came to my table.  They said: ‘What is that?’  And I said: ‘It’s a snow snake.  You can read about it on my poster.’  Then they looked at my poster for two seconds and went to get some pumpkin bread.
I worked at a make-up counter after graduating with a chemistry degree.  My African mother was so mad.  But I love make-up.  It’s like therapy.  You make people feel good.  You can change how they think, how they walk, how they talk.  It’s transformative.  Even when I got a job at a tech company, I still primarily viewed myself as a make-up artist.  I had my own website.  On the weekends I’d work weddings.  But I always wanted to do it full time.  So I finally took the leap.  I moved to New York.  I started getting on assistant lists.  I did make-up for a few web series.  I networked with people on Instagram.  It was scary at first, but it’s been three years now and I finally feel safe.  I’m getting magazine jobs.  I just did a pilot for Comedy Central.  Last month I paid off all my credit cards.  And I think my African mother is finally coming around.
I’m just beginning art school.  I’m trying to find my own voice and style.  I’m doing it in a Frankenstein sort of way.  I’m borrowing ideas and techniques from other artists, and then I try to change them a little.  It’s hard to create something new because it feels like everything has been done before.  It was easier in high school.  I was just starting out so it was impossible to disappoint myself.  But now I have some training and I feel pressure to make something good.  It seems like my work needs to have a certain quality or it’s not worth the effort.  It’s hard to get back to ‘anything goes.’
I have pretty bad social anxiety.  But I decided that I was going to be more outgoing when I went to college.  So I joined the Facebook group for incoming freshmen, and I sent a generic ‘hey’ to everyone.  Almost everyone gave me a generic ‘hey’ back, but he kept responding.  Then he added me on Snapchat.  He started sending me selfies and I responded with pictures of my living room.  He wanted to FaceTime, but I hate seeing my own face in the corner so we just talked on the phone instead.  When school finally started, we went out together with a group of people.  We didn’t make much eye contact but we did stand next to each other the entire time.  A month later we were in class and I was making fun of him for not using soap when he washes his hands.  And he said: ‘If I use soap, will you date me?’  And I said ‘yes.’  So here we are.
After graduating I worked as an industrial engineer.  I spent five years designing presses for all kinds of factories.  But it got too predictable.  I was spending eight hours in front of a computer every day.  It wasn’t enough for me.  My mind was always somewhere else.  Engineering has never just been a job for me.  It’s what makes me feel alive.  It has to be something I struggle with.  If I find the answer too easily, it has no value for me.  So I went back to school and got my PhD in biomechanics, and now I’m doing research in exoskeletons.  My lows are now lower.  I never feel smart enough.  I’m constantly discovering people who are doing similar or better work.  But my highs are also higher.  Because every time I discover a solution, it feels like I’m bringing the future closer.
I’m from a small town in the mountains of northern Georgia.  We’re famous for apples.  I moved here a week ago to try to be an actor.  Right now I’m applying for waiter positions.  I’ve got a little crypto currency and $5,000 saved from working at the carwash, so I figure I can make it for at least a year.  I did have one major role back in Georgia.  It was the guy’s first film.  I had a big death scene where a ghost blew some powder on my face and melted it off.  I’m really just taking all the jobs I can get right now so I can build a reel.  It’s mostly unpaid stuff.  I booked a music video for Sunday that I found on Facebook.  Don’t ask me the artist or genre.  All it said was: ‘Have to be comfortable being painted.’  Whatever that means.
When I went to college, I thought about joining one of those Asian student organizations.  But I wasn’t sure if I wanted to go ‘all in’ on being Asian.  I had to ask myself how integral it was to my identity.  I’ve never been very traditional.  I grew up in a white town on Long Island.  If I described myself in three adjectives, ‘Asian’ wouldn’t be one of them.  But on the other hand, the world is going to see race anyway.  I view myself as Chinese, but Asian is the first thing people see.  So if it’s how everyone sees you, should you see yourself the same way?
When I’m home, nobody will talk to me.  It’s like I am dead.  I don’t like quiet because then I have nothing.  So I ride the train into the city.  Compared to home, the city is like heaven.  There are a million people you can ask for help.  There are people to help you up the stairs.  And there are so many smells.  I love the smell of food.  Right now I’m trying to memorize my way to Carnegie Hall.  I like to go to theaters and museums where my mind can be nourished. Sometimes I can hear tourists talking about the exhibits.  Sometimes I hear college students talking to each other and it makes me feel younger.  It makes me feel like I’m still alive in this world.
We’ve been married for almost twenty years.  We have two children.  But he suffers from depression and self-medicates with alcohol.  He’ll quit drinking for stretches at a time, but he keeps falling back into it.  So I have to support our family on a single income.  And I’m just so tired of keeping him uplifted all the time.  I don’t feel emotionally supported.  There’s no physical intimacy.  But I can’t bring myself to leave.  He’s a great dad when he’s sober.  And I know that our family might be the only thing holding him together.  But I can’t help but wonder: ‘Am I missing out on an amazing relationship?’  Especially when I feel tempted at a work party.  I just miss that feeling of connection.  But my husband hasn’t crossed any red lines.  He hasn’t hit me.  He hasn’t cheated.  If I found out he cheated, it would be so easy.  And it’s gotten to the point where I almost hope he would.
Five years ago I had a bout with breast cancer.  I didn’t catch it very early.  I had to get chemo, radiation, and a mastectomy.  I’d never felt so tired in my entire life, but it didn’t just throw me off physically.  It made me really, really sad.  I lost all my enthusiasm.  I lost my positivity.  Before it happened, I had so many dreams.  I had been thinking of starting a business.  Or maybe writing stories again.  It seemed like I could accomplish anything if only I did the things that I was supposed to do.  But all that disappeared after the cancer.  I got much more self-conscious.  I started thinking: ‘If bad things can happen at any time, why even bother?’  So I’ve been in a bit of a rut these last few years.  I’ve been floating along as an office manager.  But I recently lost that job, and I’m thinking this might be my chance to go after my dreams again.  I’d love to work with young folks.  I’d love to write books and stories for children.  And I know it sounds crazy, but I really want to open a bookshop.
I came to New York when I was twenty years old.  At night I’d sleep at the YMCA, and during the day I’d go around to all the fashion houses and show them my portfolio.  I was so shy that I could barely muster up the courage.  I’d stand outside for thirty minutes before I even walked in the door.  But somehow I got a job as an illustrator for Oleg Cassini.  He was a major designer in the movies.  I’d been working there for six months when he asked me to sketch a collection of five dresses.  They were just rough outlines to show where the seaming would be.  He never told me what they were for.  Then a few weeks later I was riding on a train, and I saw my sketches in the newspaper.  They were for Jackie Kennedy to wear in the White House.
I’m producing a podcast right now and I keep coming home pissed off.  I dread getting emails from my collaborators.  I get angry every time they disagree with my approach.  It’s just that I want to feel proud of what I create.  I want everything that I make to be a reflection of myself.  And that’s impossible when you’re working with collaborators.  So I have to get better at separating myself from my work.  Every project doesn’t need to represent me as a human.  The reality is that the podcast is bigger than me.  There’s a lot of money involved.  There’s a lot of people involved.  And for some reason I’m the only one that’s pissed off.  If I keep saying that the problem is everyone else, and one by one they’re saying the problem is me, then it’s probably me.
My daughter is always asking me to play with her Barbie dolls.  I try to tell her that I’m just going to watch but she starts begging me.  So I try to do the man stuff.  You know… fix the roof, move the furniture, maybe wash the Barbie car.
Annie had a tantrum because our magazine had a Fun Zone with puzzles and I did all the puzzles.  So she started stomping around but Mommy got sick of it so Annie went to time out in our room and turned out all the lights.  I tried to go inside but she kicked her boots at me.  I waited for ten minutes and then I went in quickly and asked her to help me on a puzzle where you had to find all the differences. And that made her happy again because Annie loves puzzles.
Having twins made me a more relaxed parent.  When you watch two kids grow up at the same time, it makes you less concerned about benchmarks.  Each of them had different talents and struggles.  He could do all the physical stuff first.  We had to put a net on the crib because he was always climbing out.  He could swim first.  He learned to ride a bike several years earlier than her.  But she was potty trained first.  She was reading by the age of three.  And she was much better at drawing pictures, her fire trucks always had four wheels, and his were just red scribbles.  If I’d only had one child, I’d probably have been obsessing over these talents and struggles.  I think every parent needs to feel like their child is special.  But twins made me realize that all children grow differently.  And it’s absurd to rank and classify them at such a young age.
I want to make sure I don’t miss a second of connectedness to the brands I’m representing.  In the digital world, there’s always this feeling that if you don’t respond back, it’s a lost opportunity.  If someone is talking to you, you have to answer or they might think you don’t care.  If a client asks my opinion, and I don’t reply ‘I agree with that’—he might ask someone else.  My paycheck depends on always being connected.  So there’s always a screen in front of me.  I’m always responding to ‘pings’ and ‘dings.’  But it has a lot of consequences.  Especially on my family.  My kids are growing up, and the moments I should be focusing on are happening all around me.  So that’s where I am right now.  I want to figure out how technology and innovation can give me more time with my family, not less.
I was raised with that Jewish intellectual worship of knowledge.  But all my professors in college were small-minded nasty little bitches getting off on their own power, wanting me to parrot them while telling me they didn’t.  So I decided I was a nihilist and that I was going to do as many drugs as possible.  If the goal is to spend your whole life trying to get rewards to trigger chemicals in your brain, why not go straight for the chemicals?  But that didn’t work out very well.  It quickly became less of a philosophy, and more of a massive drug addiction.
I’m doing a review of last year.  I’m looking at all the goals I set and whether I managed to achieve them.  A big one for me was that I finally managed to get my driver’s license.  It’s a little embarrassing because I’m well past that age, but I’ve always been terrified of driving.  So I signed up for some lessons.  I studied hard.  I took extremely meticulous notes.  Then I went to the testing center with my driving instructor.  They assigned me a real hard faced guy from Eastern Europe.  My instructor told me: ‘This guy fails everyone.’  So I started off pretty nervous.  I messed up almost immediately and made a rolling stop.  I’m pretty sure I stopped completely,  but apparently it was a rolling stop.  The test seemed to go on forever.  I couldn’t charm the guy.  I tried to make conversation but he was silent the entire time.  Then after we finished, he made me sit outside his office for an eternity.  But finally he came out and told me that I’d passed!  It was such a relief!  I haven’t driven since.

I was at a rave when I was sixteen, and my mates said ‘Try this.’  And it made me the opposite of who I normally am.  I’d always been really shy, but suddenly I was dancing in the crowd and talking to everyone around me.  Everyone else had issues too so it felt like I belonged.  Soon I found a source and it became every weekend for the whole weekend.  I’d be completely wiped on Monday so I started skipping school.  I ended up flunking out.  My depression and anxiety got really bad.  I was getting in fights.  I lashed out at anyone who tried to stop me.  When I was seventeen I tried to run away from home but got pulled over.  My mom sat me down and said: ‘If you keep going down this road, you’re not a son of mine.’  I’m better now.  I just do it once a month.  I know what’s at stake.  My anxiety is much better now, but I think the stutter might be permanent.

We met two years ago at the office.  At the time he’d just gotten out of a really bad breakup.  It started with just lunch and coffee.  Then we started meeting after work.  We hooked up a little, somewhere between second and third base.  I told him that I liked him so if it wasn’t going anywhere then we couldn’t be friends. But that’s exactly what ended up happening.  It’s excruciating.  It seems like we’re always on the edge of a relationship.  We hang out.  We go to the beach.  I’ll go to his place, cook dinner, watch a movie, and then leave.  We get handsy.  We might kiss a little.  But that’s it.  Recently we went on a trip to New Zealand and shared a bed for four days.  We spooned every night but nothing else happened.  I know I’m complicit, but when I push him on it, he acts confused and says that he has a lot of friendships like this.  We kissed a little on my birthday last week.  The next day I texted him: ‘I’m not going to pretend this isn’t happening.’  He wrote back: ‘Let me think about it.  I’m in meetings.’  And he still hasn’t replied.

(Melbourne, Australia)
He’s always wanted kids.  So I thought: ‘We’ll roll the dice and see what happens.’  I honestly didn’t think I’d get pregnant.  They say it’s harder when you’re older, but here we are.  I’m not confident that I’m going to be a good mom. I think of maternal women as women who’ve always wanted kids.  I’ve known those people and watched those people and I’ve always thought: ‘I’m not like you.’  I’m afraid I’ll resent the change.  Everything stops for the kid, no matter what you’re doing.  I see my friends struggling to have a simple conversation because their kid keeps interrupting, or touching things, or running around.  That will be new.  But I’m trying to focus on the good parts.  I am excited to teach it things.  And hopefully I’ll be changed for the better.  But what if there’s not a bond?  You need that connection to stave off the resentment.  And if it’s not there, how do you fix that?  I’ve got one friend who doesn’t feel it very much.  She’s not patient with all the interruptions.  She cuts her kids off and sends them away.  She told me: ‘If I’d known what was coming, I’d never have done it.

My father had an ulcer that became infected.  It was relatively simple to cure but he refused to believe the doctors.  Instead he diagnosed himself with some sort of virus.  He stopped taking his medicine.  He created his own ointments instead.  He’s very intelligent so his reasoning could sound very convincing.  It was hard to identify when it crossed the line into mental illness.  But the infection never healed.  He went from surfing and swimming every day to barely being able to walk.  He aged twenty years.  And still he refused to go to a doctor.  He’d isolate himself from anyone who challenged him.  When he finally collapsed and was admitted to a hospital, the doctors said he had the lowest red blood cell count they’d ever seen.  Only then did he accept that things were out of his control.  He’s much healthier now.  He’s almost back to normal.  He’ll occasionally fall into the old script of defending his actions, but he manages to catch himself.

(Sydney, Australia)
I'm studying abroad right now.  I have a bit of a "boyfriend thing' going on back home.  He's a nice guy.  We met at a party and twenty minutes later he held my hair while I vomited.  Even though I wasn’t very attracted to him, he intrigued me.  I’d never met a boy who didn’t just care about sex.  I’d only dated football players and gross teenage boys.  He was different.  He genuinely cares about people.  He’d bring me all kinds of presents.  One time I had a bad week at school and he brought me a gift package with all my favorite things.  It was nice to have that much attention.  I did just enough of the girlfriend thing to keep him around.  Nothing he did affected me, and everything I did affected him.  It was a weird sense of power to be the one with less feelings.  I’d always been in the opposite position.  Even after we broke up, I still hung out with him and let him give me gifts.  He even gave me this journal for my trip.

(Melbourne, Australia)
I’m not looking to set the world on fire, but I need something to challenge me.  It feels like I’m reaching a critical juncture and I need to make some sort of decision.  Up until now I’ve just been floating along.  I’ve been at the same job for a long time.  I do the same things day in and day out: smoking, drinking, things like that.  It’s just so easy to be a consumer.  It’s so easy to reach for pleasure and avoid pain, so that you never have to face the future or think about getting old.  I don’t have anything elaborate in mind.  Maybe just get out more, or move to a new place.  Maybe have my son live with me for awhile.  I just want to prove that I can set a course and do the things I say I’m going to do.  Or if I can’t, I at least want to be honest with myself.  So I can stop beating myself up about it.

(Sydney, Australia)
I moved here from Kenya with my husband.  He became very abusive when we arrived.  He made sure I didn’t have any friends.  If anyone came to visit me, he’d immediately say: ‘I don’t like them.’  I was scared all the time.  When my mother came to visit from Africa, she could tell something was going on.  A mother can always tell. She saw how he spoke to me.  When she left for the airport, she seemed so worried about me.  It broke my heart.  So the next time he hit me, I called the police.  And I’ve never looked back.  I have a great new boyfriend now.  The kids are happy.  I’ve got a job and I’m back in school.  Things are really perfect.  But I beat myself up a lot.  I think: ‘If I’d only left earlier, I’d have been here so long ago.’  But I did leave.  I’m here now.  And that’s the important thing.  Sometimes I need to remember to pat myself on the back.

(Melbourne, Australia)
This is the first time I’ve travelled alone.  My friend told me that you learn a lot about yourself when you travel alone.  But so far, I find it the other way around.  I feel like I learn more about myself when I have to relate to other people.  Today I walked around Sydney.  I saw everything I was supposed to see.  I don’t even know why I did it.  It just felt like the thing I should be doing.  Maybe I’m just not a contemplative person.  I generally feel satisfied with my life.  I don’t feel like I’m missing anything.  I don't have to love what I'm doing to be happy.  But does that make me ignorant?  Should I be searching for something?

(Sydney, Australia)
He was clean when I met him.  He’d drink and use drugs a bit, but only when he partied.  But he’s not strong like me.  He tried heroin and he liked the feeling.  And he couldn’t stop.  It’s not that he’s a bad person.  He has a soft heart.  He smiles a lot.  But he has a demon to fight and I already tried my best to help him.  I tried to move him from the area.  I tried to get him into rehab.  I took him to parenting courses and counseling.  Things got better for about six weeks.  He was acting positive and he was there every day.   Even if we got in a fight, he’d stick around and work things out.  But then he started disappearing again.  He started getting angry and violent.  Then he’d come back on drugs and act like everything was fine.   And I wasn’t going to allow it.  You can’t just do anything you want and come home to my children.  I hate being a single mom.  It’s lonely.  I hate that I’m playing into an Aboriginal stereotype.   But ultimately my dedication is to my kids.  I haven’t cut him off completely, but now he’s on his own.  He’s got to figure it out himself.  He can’t visit my kids until he’s 100 percent.

(Sydney, Australia)
Both of us are very passionate about the environment.  We actually met at the screening of a documentary about ocean pollution.  Maybe we’ll get politically involved one day, but right now we’re just trying to live sustainable, happy lives without harming anything. We try to focus on the little victories.  Recently we set up a triage hospital to help injured ducks during hunting season.  And a few weeks ago we organized a beach clean that picked up half a ton of rubbish.  It can be hard to affect change on a global scale, but we try to set an example, and it’s nice to see ripples of change in the people around you.  I’ve even got my mom teaching vegan recipes to her friends.

The biggest insurance company in Australia collapsed in 2001, and there was a royal commission to find out the cause.  At the time I was working as a journalist.  I’d been getting the itch to write a book, so I decided that I’d become an expert on the subject.  Kind of a weird thing to choose, but I wanted to bang a peg in the ground about something.  When the book was published, I went to visit the main prosecutor and I noticed a copy sitting on her desk.  That made me feel like I’d created something of value.  The book was a bit like taking a leak in a dark suit.  Not many people noticed, but it left a warm feeling.

(Sydney, Australia)
Since there are only two million Assyrians left, there’s a feeling that we might not survive.  So we lean on our rituals.  We lean on our church.  We lean on our language, which nobody else speaks.  It's a ‘we’ culture.  Everything is about the group.  And if you wander too far from the group, you become a threat. Because the group can’t afford to lose anyone else. Your relatives will remind you that you should be proud to be Assyrian.  You’ll be reminded that our people were slaughtered.  So it’s tough to go your own way.  For the last couple months I’ve been traveling alone.  My mother is convinced that this is my breakout plan. She’s been so strict on me my entire life.  But a couple days ago she sent me a text message that brought me to tears.  It said: ‘I know that I said you've seen enough and that you should come back, but if you want to stay longer, and you feel that it's safe, than you should definitely stay.  And we'll hear from you when you come back.’

I do lifesaving training every weekend.  Sometimes we have races where we have to paddle out to buoys in the middle of the ocean.  There was one really tough race a few weeks ago.  The ocean was messy like today but the waves were even bigger.  And there were lots of bluebottles.  Those are like Jellyfish but worse.  My dad said that I didn’t have to race, and half of the competitors dropped out, but I chose to do it anyway because I wanted to prove that I could be a lifeguard.  On the outside I was ready to go but on the inside I was really nervous.  Once the race started, some of the girls turned back because the waves were so big, and others were nose-diving and falling off their boards.  But I made it all the way to the end and got fourth place.  Everyone was congratulating me because fourth place is huge for me.

(Sydney, Australia)
I come from a village.  My life would have been nothing if I’d stayed home.  I’d just wake up, cook for my siblings, and clean the house.  I wanted to do more with my life, so I’m working in the city to save for my education.  It’s been a lot lonelier than I expected.  I’m so far from home.  I spend my evenings alone in my room at the boarding house.  I have nothing to do but think of my family.  I’ve been here a year, but I still haven’t met many people because I work so much.  My coworker is my closest friend.  She’s like my mother away from home.  She reminds me to eat, take my medicine, and get enough sleep.  If she sees that I’m sad, she tells me to rest and does the work herself.  It’s just nice to feel cared for.  I’m not sure if I could make it without her.

(Manila, Philippines)
I work on cargo ships.  I’m usually at sea for nine months at a time, but sometimes it can go past a year.  My last trip was 25 months.  It’s tough out there.  You’re so far from your family.  It’s been easier since we got Internet last year.  But before that you could only make phone calls when you got to a port.  And you’d only get a letter once every two months.  My mother died during a recent trip and I couldn’t even go home for the funeral.  She was fine when I left, but somewhere off the coast of South Africa, the captain came into the engine room and told me she’d passed away.  I was so weak I couldn’t work.  The other guys volunteered to take over my shifts. Everyone chipped in some money and gave me a gift.  We do that every time someone loses a family member.  Your crew mates are all you have out there.  All of us are going through the same thing.  And if you don’t share your problems, you’ll go crazy.

My boyfriend left as soon as I got pregnant.  I was terrified to tell my father, but he discovered my pregnancy test hidden in a drawer.  He didn’t speak to me for a few days.  We’d always been close, so I knew something was up.  Finally he asked me if I wanted to tell him something.  I began to cry.  I thought he was going to kick me out of the house.  But he just went to speak with my mom in the other room, and when he came back, he asked what I planned to do.  I told him I wanted to keep the baby, and from that moment on he was very supportive.  He cooked me all kinds of dishes whenever I had cravings.  He gave me words of encouragement.  He started saving money in case I needed a cesarean section.  But during my seventh month he came down with a fever after wading through floodwater.  The next week it turned into a cough.  We took him to the hospital, went home to get clothes, but he died by the time we got back.  It was so sudden.  I had no idea what I was going to do.  I got all my strength from my father.  It seemed like keeping the baby had been a mistake.  It’s been a tough few years.  I had to drop out of school and find a job, but my son is doing well.  He’s very smart.  He comes home from school with stickers and stars.  He’s a ‘Mama’s boy.’  It’s been hard, but I’ve proven to myself that I didn’t have to end a life just because I couldn’t face it.

(Manila, Phillipines)
Soon after my father passed away, my mother got addicted to gambling. We began falling behind on the rent.  I realized what was happening when I found a Casino Filipino membership card in her wallet.  I tried confronting her, but she got furious.  She told me I had no right to tell her what to do.  She began to disappear for days at a time.  There was no money for my thesis project at school.  I’d borrow food from our relatives just to feed my younger siblings.  Then a few months ago our landlord finally kicked us out and we moved into a slum.  It was so noisy and dirty.  But I did my best to ignore it and focus on my schoolwork.  We live in an evacuation center now because the slum burned down.  My friends at school have been helping me with clothes and food.   And during it all, I’ve kept up my grades.  I’m graduating on April 3rd with a degree in Secondary Education.  I’m going to become a teacher.  I think I've already learned a special skill that teachers have to keep their personal problems out of the classroom.

I’d always been very curious as a kid.  I remember taking apart electronics and putting them back together, just to see if they’d still work.  But I lost all that enthusiasm during my teenage years.  My house became very dark, literally and figuratively.  The lights were always off.  My parents were always fighting.  We never spoke to each other, and if we did, it was always in short sentences.  All I cared about was getting out.  I put the minimal amount of effort into school.  I was angry all the time.  I went through life without any goals and ended up getting a job that I wasn’t passionate about.  But then one day I downloaded a program onto my office computer that gave me control over the entire network.  It was my introduction to hacking, and I’ve been addicted to it ever since.  I feel inspired every day.  I started learning everything I could.  I even discovered you can do it legally, so I’m back in school, getting my degree in information security.

(Manila, Philippines)
My father died on the day he got out of prison, so I never knew him.  I was on my own as a child.  I wasn’t able to go to school.  I was hungry all the time.  I’d wait all day by the marketplace until they threw out the rotten food.  And if I couldn’t find any food, I’d steal it.  I’ve spent over twenty years of my life in prison.  My last sentence was for murder.  A man slapped my mother so I stabbed him in the heart.  But I’ve been trying to change ever since I adopted my son.  I convinced his parents to let me have him because they were neglecting him.  He was extremely sick when I found him.  He was skinny like a lizard.  But now he’s spoiled.  Whenever he wants something, I give it to him.  I don’t want him to be like me.  I want him to go to school.  My neighbors are in awe of my son.  He never begs or fights.  He’s very respectful because he’s so afraid of me.  I always tell him: ‘If you ever fight or steal, I’m going to kill you.’

(Manila, Philippines)
My stepfather would come to my side of the room when everyone else was asleep.  I’d heard about these things on television, but I couldn’t believe it was happening to me.  I told nobody.  I was ashamed.  I didn’t want anyone spreading rumors.  I couldn’t even tell my mom because who would she believe: him or me?  So I just left the house when I turned seventeen.  I started sleeping at the houses of my friends.  It was so lonely.  I never stayed in the same place for long.  And my mother grew so angry with me.  It ruined our relationship.  I had been helping her raise my siblings, so she thought I was abandoning my responsibilities.  Even today she doesn’t know why I ran away.  I haven’t even told my husband about this.  But what does it matter anymore?  I’m older now.  And my stepfather’s dead.

(Manila, Philippines)
You know the story of Martha and Mary?  One of them needed to make everything perfect for Jesus, and the other one just listened to him.  Well my mother was the one who needed everything to be perfect.  She would lose her temper every Christmas because something was out of place.  She was the definition of a ‘tiger mom.’  She rarely praised me.  She showed her love through sermons and lectures.  I was afraid of her, and so I always performed well on my assignments.  I always made the honor roll.  I became an executive at a fairly young age.  I can thank her training for a lot of those things.  But one thing I never learned was how to fail.  I was always too afraid of the consequences.  So even today I’m not good with the unknown.  It’s hard for me to try something new, because I’m scared of messing up.

(Manila, Philippines)
She asked me to pick her up early from school because she was vomiting. That’s when she told me that her period was late.  We went to the store and bought a pregnancy test, but the first one came out blurry.  A few hours later we tried again and it came out clear.  I told her I wanted to break up.  I’m ashamed of it now, but I was only eighteen.  I felt like I was way too young.  I just wanted to escape.  She started crying and told me that I’m a bad person.  She said: ‘You did this to me.’  So I started crying too, and I told her I was sorry, and I told her we’d figure it out.  Our son is two years old now.  It’s happy but it’s hard.  If I didn’t have a kid right now, I’d probably be working in an office.  I’d be sitting at a desk and typing on a computer.  Instead I’m working as a messenger.  I’m outside all the time.  I’m always worried about buying milk for my kid.  We’re all living with my parents now.  We’re doing well as a couple.  Whenever we’re stressed, we talk about it together.  She understands because she gave up a lot too.  She wanted to be a cook before she met me.

I’m a researcher.  I work with local governments to draft legislation that encourages sustainable tourism.  Right now I’m working on guidelines for sea turtle interactions.  Currently there aren’t any laws regulating interactions with marine wildlife, so many species are being threatened. Dive companies are luring whale sharks with food and disrupting their migratory patterns.  Tourism isn’t a bad thing.  It benefits the economy and encourages conservation.  It just needs to be sustainable.  The industry needs to grow.  But it needs to grow in a way that doesn’t just enrich a few businessmen at the expense of our shared natural resources.

When you’re six you have like twenty-eight responsibilities.  You have to help your mom.  You have to help your dad.  And you have to keep your room clean so your parents don’t come in and see your secrets.  I have over one hundred secrets and only five have been discovered because they’re protected by lasers.  I’ll tell you one but then I’ll have to throw it away.  I’m a real ninja master because I got powers from glowing red rocks I found in the caverns of lost treasure.  Someone hid them there in the 1980’s during World War 7.  That’s all I can tell you now because I don’t want everybody to know how special I am.

(Manila, Philippines)
My young son is very curious.  Every time I come home, he asks me so many questions.  He wants to know all about my day.  It's motivating for me because I always want to have something exciting to tell him.  But recently I’ve been out of work so there isn’t much to say.  I’ve been going on so many interviews without any luck.  I don’t try to hide anything from him because he sees that I’m striving.  I just tell him: ‘I’m looking for a job that suits me, and I still haven’t found the right one yet.’  But today I finally found a new job selling security equipment.  I’m starting tomorrow.  So I’m very excited to go home and report the good news.

(Manila, Philippines)
I’m starting an advocacy group at my university to break the stigma around domestic violence.  We have about seventy members so far.  I want to give women the confidence to speak about things that they only whisper about.  I know what it’s like.  I lived under the reign of my father for most of my life.  He’d throw things.  He’d punch us.  I had to do so many little things to help us survive.  I told the nuns at my school.  I told our neighbors to call the police if they heard screaming.  I made a duplicate key so we could go back for food whenever we escaped the house.  During one argument I tried to put myself between him and my mother.  He grabbed a knife and held it to my throat for three minutes.  I remember him saying: ‘You’re a disgrace to me,’ and ‘I never wanted you,’ and ‘You make life harder.’  I was terrified, but I’d been terrified for most of my life, so I knew exactly what to do.  I removed my mind from the situation. I prayed for my mother.  I tried to reflect on my life.  I remember feeling happy because I’d been alive for fourteen years, and I’d protected my mother for all that time.

(Manila, Philippines)
Now I have someone to play with!

(Manila, Philippines)
I had to break up with my girlfriend last week.  We’d been trying to hide our relationship because our parents think we’re too young to date.  I’d been telling my mom we were just friends.  And we told her dad I was gay.  But last week a neighbor took a picture of us kissing in the park, and my mom surprised me with the pictures when I got home.  I had to promise that I’d end the relationship and focus on my studies.  I’m actually on my way to her house right now.  But it’s only because I need help with a school project.

Thanks to everyone who donated to the fundraiser this week!  As of this moment, $1,836,000 has been raised from over 35,000 donors.  That will be enough to build 3,000 sturdy bamboo houses for Rohingya refugees that are currently living in make-shift plastic shelters.  A family of five can live in each house, so with monsoon season approaching, these houses will significantly improve the living conditions of **nearly 15,000 people.**  Thank you so much to everyone who donated.  I’ll be leaving the fundraiser up for the rest of the day for anyone who’d still like to make a donation:

Before moving on, I want to give a special thanks to Jerome Jarre, who was largely the inspiration for this fundraiser.  (Pictured here with Sai’d, who’s story we shared yesterday.)  Last year, Jerome teamed up with a group of You Tubers and social media influencers to form Love Army—which has raised nearly $5,000,000 to help displaced people in Somalia as well as Rohingya refugees.  I was most impressed by the fact that Jerome then moved to both Somalia and Bangladesh for several months to ensure the money was being used effectively with zero overhead costs.  Jerome and Sa’id will be working with hundreds of paid Rohingya volunteers to construct the houses we’re funding, and will ensure all $1,800,000 goes directly to refugees.  So thank you, Jerome and Sa’id, for your work and inspiration.
There were no jobs during the civil war, so my dad went from being an engineer to selling food.  We had a shop in the main market of Mogadishu and during the day I helped him run the business.  One morning I stepped outside to take a phone call, and a mortar hit our building.  Twelve people were killed on the spot.  I fell down in the middle of the road.  My right thigh was broken.  For ten minutes I lay in the street because everyone was too scared to get me.  When I finally got to the hospital, it was chaos.  There was no electricity.  There were people in the hallways with their stomachs open.  Doctors and nurses were making quick decisions without a second thought.  I heard someone say to just cut off my leg.  But there was an American surgeon from Los Angeles in that hospital.  His name was Oscar.  He had come to Somalia just to save lives.  And under the most difficult circumstances he operated on my leg.  He was like a miracle.  I knew that God had saved me for a reason.  I too was going to be a humanitarian. (2/2)

I’m ending the Rohingya series by sharing the story of Sa'id, who is helping oversee the construction project we are helping to fund.  (We’ve raised over $1.5 million so far, which is enough to build over 2,500 houses.)  Sai’d works with the American Refugee Committee, who is partnering with Love Army to provide logistical and organizational support.  As is evident from his story, this work is very personal to Sa’id because he is a refugee himself.  Today is the final day of our fundraiser.  We’re almost up to 30,000 donors.  If we reach $1.8 million, that will be 3000 houses.  *Those houses can hold 15,000 people.  Every little bit matters, so
I was twenty when the civil war came to Somalia.  It started as a normal day for me.  I woke up that morning thinking about applying to university.  Suddenly I heard big sounds like cannon in the distance.  Then came the sounds of gunfire.  The fighting spread so fast.  By that afternoon I saw two dead bodies in the street.  I had never seen a dead person in my life.  My neighborhood became a battleground, but we couldn’t leave because there was no transportation.  There was no water or electricity.  The ATM’s wouldn’t work.  Mortars began to fall near our house so we took shelter in a nearby school.  I remember that first night, sleeping on the floor of the school, listening to the BBC Somali service on a handheld radio.  I had no idea what was happening.  In just a few hours my life had gone from thinking about college to only thinking about surviving.

My parents fled Myanmar twenty-five years ago, so I was born in these camps.  I feel like a prisoner here.   I don’t have any rights.  The only thing that refugees are allowed to do is exist.  It’s not legal for us to study.  It’s not legal for us to work.  Even if I earned a PhD, I wouldn’t be able to get a job in Bangladesh.  But we can’t go home.  The only thing worse than being here is going back to Myanmar.  Some of my family decided to stay in Myanmar.  A few months ago I got a call from my cousin in the middle of the night.  He told me: ‘Pray for us.  We are going to die.  I am watching everyone die and there’s nothing I can do.’  I told him that we’d pray for him.  I could hear gunshots in the background.  And then he hung up.  A few weeks later he arrived alone in the camp.  He told us that fifty of our relatives were killed that night.  He was the only one who escaped.



**One day left for our fundraiser.** This week I'm sharing a series of first hand accounts from Rohingya refugees. The Rohingya are a persecuted ethnic minority who have been violently evicted from Myanmar by the military and Buddhist extremists. Over the past year, nearly 700,000 Rohingya have been driven from their homes and are now residing in refugee camps in Bangladesh. Their living conditions are already dire, and monsoon season is approaching. As we share their stories, we are raising money to help build inexpensive bamboo houses for these refugees. (They are currently living in plastic tents.) Bamboo houses can be built for $600 a piece, and we’ve raised enough for nearly 2000 houses so far, but the need is much more. There’s only one day left in our campaign, so
The military arrested a leader of our village and took him out into the forest.  The next morning, we broke into small groups and everyone went searching for him.  I went with two of my friends.  We were searching in the forest when I heard one of them scream.  I ran over to see what he found.  It was the man we were looking for, but his neck had been cut.

It was 2 AM when they came to our village.  They set all our houses on fire.  There was no time to grab anything.  Not even food.  All we could do was run.  For fifteen days we walked without any food.  There were bodies all along the path.  Only fear kept us going.  We had no energy.  People were sitting down to rest and never standing up again.  We started eating leaves off the trees.  I couldn’t breastfeed anymore.  One of my children died on the sixth day.  Another died a few days later.  Nobody even talked about it.  We were too weak.  I could barely even cry.  We just walked on in silence.  When we arrived at the camps, the doctor told me my baby was not going to survive.  But by the grace of Allah, she lived.

I was walking home from the paddy fields when I heard the sound of a bullet.  A young boy fell right next to me.  Then suddenly there were so many bullets that it seemed like rain.  I ran straight to my house and told my family to run.  I told them to run deep into the forest and I started grabbing everything I could.  I tried to follow them but it was raining too hard.  I kept losing my balance because I was carrying our bags.  It took me an hour to find them.  I was screaming their names like a madman. Finally I discovered tracks in the mud and found my children huddled in the woods, but my wife was not with them.  Nobody knew where she was.  It was too dangerous to stay so we had to keep moving.  We walked for three days without food and water.  The children kept asking for their mother, but I didn’t know what to tell them.  I thought we had lost her forever.  Finally on the fourth day someone told us they’d passed her on the road.  They said she was alone and crying.  We were starving and didn’t have the energy to go back.  But our nephew volunteered to find her, and tell her that we’d meet her in Bangladesh.

They came to our house first because it’s closest to the road.  We thought they just wanted to talk.  We thought they’d ask us some questions, and then they’d leave.  So we walked out to meet them.  I smelled smoke as soon as I walked outside.  And they started shooting their guns.  There was no time to go back.  They were shooting so I couldn’t go back.  And I couldn’t bring anything with me.  I just ran into the forest with my children.  And I forgot my baby boy.  I left him in the house because I thought we were coming right back.  I wanted to save him but my husband held me down.  So my baby burned in the house.  I’d have brought him with me, but I thought we were coming right back.

I looked out my window and saw smoke coming from the village across the river. At first I thought it was a casual fire. But then I heard shooting, and I saw people were trying to swim across the river. We knew that our village would be next. I grabbed what I could carry and ran toward the mountain. We hid in the bushes all day. There were thousands of us on that mountain. Anyone who tried to talk was shushed. We looked down on our village and watched them burn our houses. Before they burned mine, they carried everything out. They took all my furniture. They took two hundred bags of lentils. I’m a schoolteacher, but I owned a lot of farmland. I paid taxes on my land for decades. I have all my paperwork. I have all my receipts. But they took it all from me. I wasn’t able to bring a single grain of rice with me. These papers are all I have. They are worthless now. But my hope is that one day they’ll have value again. This week I'm sharing a series of first hand accounts from Rohingya refugees.

Nobody was prepared for this. There are now 700,000 people trying to figure out how to survive in the middle of nowhere. A few months ago, this entire area was a national forest reserve. It was covered with trees. But the refugees had nothing when they arrived, so they started cutting the trees for fuel. Then they moved on to shrubs. Now they’ve dug up all the roots so there’s nothing left but loose soil. It’s too dangerous for them to go home so we’re trying to make the best of the situation. Almost all the refugees are living in plastic tents right now. They’re extremely vulnerable. So we’ve designed sturdy bamboo houses and we’re building them as fast as we can. We want to finish as many as possible before the monsoon season arrives. ——————————————This week I’m sharing a series of first hand accounts from Rohingya refugees. Alongside these stories, we’ll meet a few of the wonderful people who are working to make the situation better. This is Immad, a construction coordinator for the humanitarian organization OBAT Helpers BD. Immad is a hero of our tale because he designed the bamboo houses that we are currently raising money to build. Our campaign has raised over $500,000 so far. That’s enough to build nearly 800 houses. Because each house can hold a family of six, that’s enough to shelter nearly 5,000 people. A pretty remarkable achievement, but there are still nearly a million refugees without homes. So if you haven’t already, please consider donating here:


They didn’t say a word. They just started firing into the air and lighting our houses on fire. The burning began on the north side of our village, so we fled south into the forest. We walked all night through the dark. I could hear people in the forest all around me. We were too afraid to rest. When the sun began to rise, everyone panicked and started to run. I noticed two children leaning against a tree. Both of them were crying. The boy said nothing. The girl would only tell me that her mother had been killed. When I asked if they wanted to come with me, they nodded ‘yes.’ I’m taking care of them the best I can, but it’s difficult because I already have a large family. I think they are happier now. The girl has made some friends in camp. But she still keeps asking about her mother. This week I'm sharing a series of first hand accounts from Rohingya refugees.

It’s been happening since our grandparents’ time. We haven’t had a day of peace. Every night the military would knock on our door and demand that we give them sheep or goats. The police would stop us on the way to market and arrest us for no reason. Just for being Muslim. They’d take us to the police station and make us clean the toilets. If you asked ‘why,’ you’d be beaten. On the night they came to burn our village, we barely survived. The bullets came through our walls all night. My brother was shot in the stomach. I thought any moment would be the end. At first light I put my daughter on my shoulder and started to run. There were pieces of people all over the road. Every time I passed a dead body, I would switch her to the other shoulder. This week I'm sharing a series of first hand accounts from Rohingya refugees.

It was early in the morning when the military came. I woke up to a big sound that sounded like a bomb blast. Then the shooting started and everyone was screaming. We ran for our lives. It was dark and there were people running all around us. It only took us thirty minutes to get to safety because our village is close to the border. But then some of us decided to go back. There were five of us. We were curious. We wanted to see what happened to the others. We crawled on our stomachs to the top of a hill, and looked down at our village. There were so many dead bodies. Some of them were my cousins. I saw a girl from school with three soldiers kneeling on top of her. They were covering her mouth so she wouldn’t scream. I felt so dizzy. I couldn’t stand up. I used to have a dream that I was going to grow up and help my family. I was studying hard. Now I don’t even know why I’d want to live in this world.

During my recent trip to Bangladesh, I spent several days outside of Cox’s Bazaar, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees have settled into camps. I’ll be sharing some of their stories over the next week. The situation is quite dire and many of the stories will be tough to read. But during this time, we’ll be having a fundraiser to impact the lives of refugees in a direct way—by building sturdy homes before the monsoon season arrives. I’ll be explaining more about the fundraiser throughout the series, but you can find it here: One limitation of social media is that you're forced to share information in small bursts, which can make it difficult to convey context. This is especially unfortunate when dealing with something as complex as the Rohingya refugee crisis. So for anyone interested in the bigger picture, I’d recommend this recent series in The Globe and Mail by photojournalist Renaud Phillipe: Hopefully as we spend the next week learning the stories of these refugees, we can also play a small part in softening their hardships.


I was tired of renting a room.  It was so much pressure.  Every month would pass by so quickly and the landlord would be knocking on my door again.  If I didn’t have the money, he would knock every day.  I couldn’t take the stress.  I just wanted a place where I could relax.  So I saved for two years to buy a house in the slum.  It wasn’t a legal house because it was built on government land, but it was all I could afford.  I tried to make it nice.  I gathered scrap wood and created an extra room.  I built my own bathroom.  I slept so well there.  Nothing was burdening me.  Then one day I got a letter on my door.  Everyone in our slum got the same letter.  It said we needed to leave because the government was planning to build a road on the land.  Armed guards came the next morning and bulldozed all our houses.  That was three years ago.  They still haven’t built the road.

This is my older sister’s business. I’m just helping her out. I barely knew her for most of my life. We come from a village, and she moved to the city when I was a baby. She supported our whole family. Everyone depended on her. She sent us money every month, but I barely knew her. I only spoke to her on the phone. A few years ago I followed in her footsteps and moved to Jakarta, and now we’ve become very close. I can finally witness the sacrifices that she’s made for us. She works all the time. She owns this small restaurant and runs a furniture business out of her home. Even though she’s a woman, she does all the marketing and negotiating herself. She wakes up early in the morning to search for wood in torn out buildings. When she comes home at night, her body is so tired that she goes directly to sleep. I want to become like her so she can rest. But I’m afraid I’m too naïve. When I watch her, I feel like she can do anything.(Jakarta, Indonesia)




We must teach religion in our schools. We must start them really, really young. As soon as they know how to point out basic things like ‘rock, milk, tree.’ That is the best time to start. Not too much. Just one hour a day until they are about seven. Enough to teach them the basic prayers and Arabic alphabet. It has to be compulsory. You don’t have to force them to believe. But you must force them to study. It’s the most important thing in life. All of us have animal thoughts and lust. Only with God do you start having rules. Even the Christians have rules. I have a Christian relative. They pray to God as well. And the Hindus, well I don’t really understand Hinduism, but they have something too. You must have a higher power. When a man lives without God, it’s very dangerous. You have no reference, no principles, no precepts. You are almost equal to animal.(Jakarta, Indonesia)




He had a heart attack at the office. He was only forty years old. We’d left the house together that morning, but he never came home. I was in shock. They told me to cry but I couldn’t. I lost so much weight. My children were still so young and I knew I’d have to fight alone. I’d let my husband pamper me for my entire life. We were always together. There were so many things I didn’t understand because he’d taken care of everything. He’d always driven us everywhere. I’d fall asleep in the car the moment we got on the highway. So I had to learn to read maps, and figure out directions, and how to wait for the bus. It made me so nervous when the crowd started pushing, but I learned to push too. I learned to go to the pharmacy and wait in line. It seems so simple, but my husband had always been the one who went to the pharmacy. I had to teach myself all these things. But God made it easy for me. The time has passed so fast. I supported us by working as a teacher and I’ve educated both my children. Now they’re teachers themselves. And my daughter is getting married this Saturday. My son is going to walk her down the aisle. (Jakarta, Indonesia)




We were married for three years. But my parents never approved of her. They didn’t think she was good enough. They always told me: ‘You can date her, but don’t marry her.’ And she didn’t like them either. She didn’t like to be around them because she always felt judged. Things really got bad after our daughter was born. She didn’t want to live in my hometown. She didn’t come along when I went home to visit. We got in a huge fight about it one day. I started saying bad words to her, and eventually I said: ‘Let’s just end it.’ It was an emotional decision. We have three types of divorces in our religion, and I chose the most final. Which means we are never allowed to remarry. Afterwards it felt like a dream. I shouldn’t have acted so quickly. I spoke with her recently and both of us regret the decision. My daughter barely recognizes me when I visit. But what can we do? We can’t go against the rules of God.(Jakarta Indonesia)




My mother lost her eyesight slowly. At first her eyes began to change colors. The doctor told us that she needed a surgery, and I promised her I’d get the money. It was my dream to save her eyesight. I did some repair work. I helped our neighbors with construction projects. But I ran out of time and she went completely blind. Soon afterwards she fell very sick. She had to stay in bed for months. I was always there by her side. Even if there were a lot of people at home, she only felt at peace if I was next to her. I cleaned her. I fed her. I put my number on speed dial so she could call me at work. Toward the end she began to imagine things. My family thought she was losing her mind, but I think she was just lonely in the dark. She told me that she saw children. She told me there were princes coming for her. I’d sit and talk with her about the things she saw. I kept talking to her after she fell into a coma. I prayed with her. I asked her to forgive my father. I asked her to forgive me for not saving her eyesight. I didn’t have the money. But I gave her all that I could, which was my service.(Jakarta, Indonesia)




My daughter was about to graduate high school when I lost my husband to a motorbike accident. She wanted to go to university but there was no one to support us. I’m an old-fashioned person. I’m not very smart. I only graduated from junior high school. But I wanted her to be better than me. I asked our relatives for help, but they all refused me. Out of desperation I approached my landlord. And she was the only one who supported us. She told me: ‘Get back on your feet so your daughter will have a chance.’ She loaned us half the tuition. The other half I earned by working morning to night. I was doing laundry. I was doing dishwashing. I was going around selling cookies and cakes. My daughter graduated recently and became a midwife. All my hard work paid off. We’ve been paying back the loan. And a few months ago she asked for my bank account number, and she’s been putting money in every week.(Jakarta, Indonesia)




I feel like God has given me a talent for art, and using that talent is a form of gratitude. For years I worked in an automotive workshop. I’d try to paint when I came home, but I never had any energy left. So I finally quit. Now I have more freedom to develop my talents, but it hasn’t been easy. Art is more difficult in this country. It’s not really seen as a profession. It would be easier if I was alone, but I have a family to support so there’s a lot of pressure to earn. I’m trying to be tough in poverty. I read a lot of poetry to give me strength. I would never beg, so right now I’m drawing portraits and caricatures to support myself. I’d rather be painting what I think and feel, but I have to fulfill what the consumer wants.(Jakarta, Indonesia)




Mom raised me on her own since I was young. My dad didn’t care about our family. He was there physically, but he wasn’t there. He kept all his income for himself. He gambled away our possessions. We couldn’t buy anything for ourselves because he would sell it. He sold all our electronics. He even sold our furniture. But my mother still did everything for him: cooked his food, did his laundry… everything. Then one day she came home from work and the house was empty. There was nothing left but our clothes. I told her it was time to go. For the last two years we’ve been living in a rented house together. Mom seems so much lighter now. We can own our own things. We can actually make progress and move forward in life. I've started working at a pharmacy and I'm paying my way through college. I’m still in touch with my father. I even give him money for rent and food. I have no interest in taking revenge. I’m showing him how he should have treated us. (Jakarta, Indonesia)




I’m a fund manager. One of my employees stole millions from my clients. He hid it from me for almost two years. He was working with a broker to create fake transactions. He disappeared when I discovered the scheme. I could call the police but it would be all over the press, and I’d never get another client. I could declare bankruptcy but I’m not a coward. So I’m trying to pay my clients back the initial amount they invested. I sold my other business. I sold two houses and a car. That’s why I’m taking trains and online taxis. Some of my clients feel sorry for me. Most of them are angry. A few hate me. All of them keep calling. I tell them to give me time, but they keep calling. I’m smoking four packs of cigarettes a day because of the stress. I’ve got to find fresh money. If I can get new clients, then I can slowly repay the old ones with the profits that I make. But all of them want their money now. (Jakarta, Indonesia)




Several years ago my father used our house for collateral on a business loan. When things fell apart, we lost everything. My dad got depressed and fell sick. My mother was backed into a corner. She had four young children but no income. At the time she was a very feminine housewife. But she asked our neighbors to teach her how to farm. Then she convinced our landlord to let her plant an empty field. He told her, ‘If you can make it yield anything, we’ll split the profits.’ It didn’t succeed right away. There were a lot of pests. Some of the crops dried out. But my mother harvested whatever was left, and it was enough to support our family. She cut off her hair during this time. She got very muscular. She worked all day in the fields but still found time to make sure we went to school. If my brothers and I ever started crying, she’d tell us: ‘If I’m strong enough to do this, you’re strong enough to go to school.’ (Jakarta, Indonesia)




I tried to pick my wife up from her religious group one night, but her friends told me that she’d left with someone else. She told me the guy was just a friend. But over the next few months, I started to hear more and more things. Somebody saw her coming out of a hotel with another man. Then a few weeks later I discovered them on a beach together. Then finally I came home early one day and found them in my house. I was heartbroken. Because I really did love her. I left town immediately after the divorce because I didn’t want to be reminded of the heartbreak. I’ve lived in Jakarta for three years now. I have my own shop. I’ve saved a lot of money. I’m doing better than I ever have before. My plan was to become successful and win my wife back, but my daughter tells me that she’s already remarried. So I’m hoping to meet someone else. One of my customers was left by her husband. She also has older children. We’ve been talking on the phone a lot lately. (Jakarta, Indonesia)


We were planning to swim today but then we decided to go looking for foreigners. Rayhan had never seen one before. Foreigners are fun and handsome. If you get a picture with one of them, you’ll get a lot of likes on Facebook. We found a few already. There was one family from France that was really nice and let us a take a picture. Then we found one other girl but she was kind of snobby. She said some words in English and walked away quickly. Maybe she was feeling sick. (Jakarta, Indonesia)




It was spontaneous. I didn’t ask for permission. We’d been dating for five months, so I just decided to go for it. We were standing on a beach. Watching the sunset. I waited for the perfect moment when she wasn’t paying attention. Then I leaned in and kissed her on the cheek. At first she was silent. She gave me a bit of a side look. I thought I’d messed up. So I pointed at the waves and pretended that I saw something in the ocean. I let things cool down for a few months before trying again. (Jakarta, Indonesia)




I tried to start a business right out of high school. I didn’t have much experience. But a mutual friend showed me a business model and I agreed to partner with him. We supplied wholesale groceries like onions, barley, and garlic. My partner did the purchasing and kept all the books. I just supplied the money to purchase more stock. I was completely dependent on the information he gave me. And at first we showed a lot of profit. Every time we filled an order, there would be an even bigger order. So I just kept putting more money into the business. That went on for four years. But when I finally tried to take some profits, my partner claimed there was no money. He showed me an entirely new set of books. He’d stolen everything, and I couldn’t prove a thing because I hadn’t been keeping my own records. I hid it from my wife for days. We had two kids and I’d just lost everything. But when I finally told her, she supported me. She only told me that I couldn’t sit around and think about it. So I got a job as a taxi driver. I was done with business forever. That was twenty years ago. Both my kids are educated now. They’ve grown up to be good human beings. And that guy never changed. He kept cheating people. Last I heard, he was in hiding somewhere.(Dhaka, Bangladesh)




These types of shops are notorious for cheating people. A lot of them use fake parts to fix your car. But I take pride in doing things right. And most of my profits go back into the business. I could stash all my money in the bank, but I’d rather use it to create jobs. I support five employees with this shop. I handpicked them myself. All of them were being paid horribly at their old jobs. They were living in horrible conditions. They had families to support but were barely making enough to feed themselves. So I paid them double, gave them shelter, and gave them food. If the work is getting done, they can have as much freedom as they want. I don’t give them metrics. The most important thing is that they’re happy. (Dhaka, Bangladesh)




The land where I grew up was very rich. The property was empty when my father bought it, but he plowed it with cows and grew many crops there. He built it up from nothing. I have many memories there as a child. The land was next to a river. There were lots of coconut trees. The trees didn’t belong to anyone but they felt like my own. My father died when I was five years old and passed the land on to me. It was my only possession. It was my back-up plan. I worked as a janitor in the city, but I always returned to visit my mother and bring her money. It was in my twenties that I began to notice that the river was eroding the soil. Every time I returned, a bit more had fallen into the water. There was nothing I could do. We stayed until the water was five feet from our door. On the day we left, my mother told me: ‘One day you’ll realize how hard your father worked for this.’ And that’s the hardest part. The land was my only memory of my father. And now I can’t show it to my kids. I feel like it’s not just my inheritance that’s underwater, but all my father’s hard work.(Dhaka, Bangladesh)




My mother passed away during childbirth, and a woman from a nearby village tried to purchase me from my grandfather. At first he was insulted, but the woman kept begging, so he finally agreed to marry her into our family. She never breastfed me. She never showed me affection. And the moment she had children of her own, she abandoned me. I was ten years old at the time. Her new husband threw my school bag into a lake and told me to go find work. I moved straight to the city. There were times I was so hungry that I made soup out of goat food. But I never begged and I never stole. There are a lot of bad people in the city, but I was lucky enough to meet the good ones. People who showed me the right path. A restaurant owner let me live with him in exchange for washing dishes. Then when I was fifteen, an old Pakistani man taught me how to drive, and I became a bus driver. I met my wife while driving that bus. We have three children of our own now. I have nothing to leave them when I’m gone. But all of us are well fed and well housed. (Dhaka, Bangladesh)




My boyfriend would do all sorts of crazy things when we first met. We’d talk until four in the morning. He said he’d die to be with me. But the moment he knew that I was falling for him, he suddenly grew cold. He’d call me names. He’d disappear for days every time we argued. And he started spending time with other girls. He said they were just friends, but it bothered me. Plus he would never commit. I asked him for a commitment because my parents are trying to fix my marriage, but he just listened to me cry. He wouldn’t say a word. During one of the periods that he wasn’t talking to me, I reconnected with an old crush from my childhood. And this new guy treated me so well. He even came to meet my parents to show that he was serious. But my boyfriend logged onto my Facebook and discovered our messages. And he started crying and begged me not to leave. He said he’d marry me if I came back to him. So I did. But now he’s saying that he hasn’t decided if he can forgive me.(Dhaka, Bangladesh)




I feel like girls aren’t safe anywhere. Maybe I’m watching too many crime series on television, but I’m scared to ever leave her alone. I even get nervous when she goes to school because the driver is male. I do my best to teach her to be safe. I tell her how to react if a man approaches her. I tell her what is not appropriate. But she’s so shy. She’s silent around adults. So I’m scared that she won’t stand up for herself. And that if something happens, I’m afraid she’ll never tell me about it.(Dhaka, Bangladesh)




Invention is my hobby. I want to invent all kinds of inventions. Many things I have invented already. This is my first invention, which is quite small. It is a generator. One motor can generate electricity from the other motor. I will make a bigger one when I get some money. There are so many wonderful inventors. There is a scientist named Dr. Hanson who has made a wonderful robot that can talk. She can’t say her favorite color, but she is still a beautiful robot. Dr. Hanson is a great scientist and wonderful man. I will be a great scientist too. One day I will go to Australia and make a flying car that doesn’t make pollution. I already have the idea in my brain.(Dhaka, Bangladesh)


I started this business two years ago when I was twelve. An older friend told me that we could make good money selling fruit. We buy the fruit from villages and bring it to the city where it gets a much higher price. My friend is six years older than me, but he couldn’t keep up, so I set off on my own. I work every day. I’ve already made enough money to buy some land. I’m going to build a house and use the rest for farming. My parents tell me that I should be in school. I respect their views, but I also make more money than them. So it’s hard to listen. Plus I’m learning a lot about business. Even though I’m skipping school, I don’t think I’m skipping education.(Dhaka, Bangladesh)




I always sat in the first row. I always had the highest rank in class. I wanted to be a teacher, just like my teachers. But when it was time to enroll in grade seven, my mother told me we couldn’t afford it. I cried and begged but she just stayed silent. My teachers were so sad that they offered to pay half of the tuition. But it wasn’t enough because we'd still have to pay for the books and exams. So my mother made me understand that school was not in my luck. I’m still seventeen, but now I’m married and I work as a maid for a family. I wash their clothes, wash their dishes, clean their bathroom. Their house is near a school. So every morning I have to watch the children walk by in their uniforms. (Dhaka, Bangladesh)




My husband passed away when my children were very small. I taught myself handicrafts to survive, but it barely earned enough for us to eat. When my oldest son turned eighteen, I found him a wife. I was hoping that she’d help with the household. But she abandoned us after my granddaughter was born. I came home from work one day and found the child alone. I could only get her to stop crying by soaking an apple in goat’s milk. I’ve been raising her ever since that day. She calls me ‘mummy.’ With a lot of hardships I have made her grow. She survives on apples and milk. But I’m old. And when I’m gone, I don’t know who will take care of her. (Udaipur, India)

I want to be a police. I’ll find the robbers because they have handkerchiefs on their faces. I’ll tell them that it’s bad to steal. And to never steal again. Then I’ll hit them with a stick and their mom and dad will yell at them. And if they don’t listen, I’ll hit them with a stick again.(Udaipur, India)




I’m known for my honesty. My grandfather taught me that it’s better to carry rocks on your head than to make a dishonest living. I’ve never taken a bribe. I’ve worked in the judicial court for decades and have been offered all sorts of money and gifts. A hospital once offered me an entire floor of their building, if only I’d settle a dispute in their favor. I told them to take it up with someone else. (Udaipur, India)




After we met, I got tired of waiting for him to call. So I dialed his number, let it ring once, and hung up. When he called back I told him it was an accident. Then we spoke for an hour. Now we’re on our honeymoon. (Udaipur, India)




We’re from different castes so we have to meet in secret. My parents would never approve. When my older sister married someone outside of the caste, everyone stopped talking to her. So we have to be careful. My parents actually know about him. He sent me a bunch of heart emojis once and my Mom picked up the phone. I tried to say we were just friends but she saw the words ‘Darling’ and ‘Sweetheart.’ She slapped me when she saw it. She thinks that we don’t talk anymore. When I’m financially independent, I’ll finally tell her the truth. But it’s going to be bad. -Calcutta, India


I want to do something for our nation. At first I wanted to be a doctor, but I discovered another path to saving lives. I’m studying agriculture now. I’d like to help invent new seeds to increase yields. Small farmers in India are struggling. They just can’t compete with industrial farms. Most of them live in isolated villages, and it costs too much to bring their goods to market. It can be cheaper for them to dump their crops on the side of the road. Meanwhile people in our country are going hungry! It doesn’t make any sense. But if we invent new seeds that increase the yield of their land, small farmers can survive. If I do my job well, there will be no need for doctors. Also my mom would like to see my name in the newspaper. (Udaipur, India)




Marriage is about two things: sexual satisfaction and building generations. Nothing more. Only useless people are thinking about love. The result of a love marriage is never satisfactory. Divorce, arguments, affairs. These things don’t happen in arranged marriage. Arranged marriage is always successful. Love is for useless people. But if you’re going to feel love, at the very least, make sure it’s someone of a similar income level. (Jaipur, India)
I used to drink beer every once in awhile.  That was all.  But several members of my family died in a few years time.  The worst was my brother.  He was younger than me.  And after his death I lost all control.  Now I can’t stop drinking.  I’ll quit for a few weeks at a time, but then I’ll get this feeling: ‘Let me have a little bit today.’  Then I’ll drink continuously for five or six days until the shivers kick in.  It’s ruining my health.  It’s causing me to neglect my work.  My family is ashamed.  And I live with a constant feeling of doing wrong.  But I can’t stop.  And even if I did, I feel like I’m too old and it’s too late.

(Jaipur, India)


I came to the city when I was twenty and became a fruit seller. It’s allowed me to build a house in my village. I feel healthy. I get to eat. A lot of people don’t get to eat on time. So I’ve gotten everything I wanted. The minute you think: ‘I have a lot’—that’s the moment your spirit is at rest. My spirit is at rest. (Jaipur, India)


One night there was a huge storm and he didn’t come home from work. I had told him to sleep at the shop, but he wouldn’t listen to me. And by nighttime he still hadn’t arrived. The trains shut down. The phones stopped working. I sat by the window all night with my children. I asked everyone who walked by if they’d seen him. The next morning I went to the temple and said so many prayers. Then at 11 AM, I heard the bell ring. And there he was. He was soaking wet and completely covered in mud. He smelled awful. I started crying so hard. I made him some hot tea and a little food, and he went straight to bed. When he finally woke up, I informed him that he would be moving his shop next to the house.(Mumbai, India)


I sell grain for people to feed the pigeons and cows. It’s a way to get good karma. This has been our family’s business for eighty years. It began with my grandfather, then my father, and now it’s mine. I have about 250 or 300 clients that I see every day. Things were going very well. We had two houses. A car. Lots of gold. But a few years ago my brother-in-law got kidney disease. Our family spent everything to save him. We travelled all over India. People said: ‘go here, go there,’ and we always went. And we always paid whatever they asked. My mother even donated her kidney. But nothing worked. He died seven months ago. My parents passed away soon after because of the stress. Now I’m all alone. I own nothing but a scooter. I still believe in karma. Without it I have nothing left. But only God knows what I did to deserve this. If I knew, I wouldn’t have done it.(Jaipur, India)


I don’t want her to depend on anyone when she grows up. From the very beginning, I’ve been dependent. I barely left my home until the age of eighteen. I'd only walk from school to home, and even then I’d be accompanied by my brother. I had no idea how to face the world outside. I never even learned to ride a bike. It’s going to be different for her. I told my husband: ‘Whatever she wants to do, I’m going to support her.’ And I’ve already gotten a bike for her. The moment she is old enough, I’m teaching her to ride a bike.(Jaipur, India)


We let her pick the kite."

(Udaipur, India)


We moved to the city thirty years ago when I was a small child. We hardly had a penny at the time. My father sacrificed everything for us. If I needed new clothes, he’d wear old clothes. And he never complained. If business wasn’t good, he’d keep it to himself so we wouldn’t have to worry. Once when I was twelve years old, I really wanted a bicycle. So he bought one for me. Shortly after that, I noticed that he wasn’t wearing his favorite ring. He told me that he was getting it fixed. When I became an adult, I asked him again: ‘Where is that ring? I want to make one just like it.’ Finally he told me: ‘I sold that ring to get your bicycle.’ (Jaipur, India)

The only time they’re peaceful is when they’re watching cartoons. They argue over everything. They fight over toys. They call each other names. But as much as they fight, they also can’t live without each other. Anytime I try to separate them, two minutes later they’re talking again. (Jaipur, India)




My wife passed away last month. She started shivering when she came out of the bath, and then she fainted. I took her to the hospital but she had a heart attack before I could admit her. I’m trying to stay busy. I’m OK when I’m at work, but the minute I enter my home, I begin to think about her. Her photographs are still by my bedside. Thankfully my ten-year-old grandson has been sleeping with me. He watches my shows with me. And he talks constantly. He goes on about his school and his class and his teachers. A lot of what he says is nonsense, but I enjoy it. And when he falls asleep, I fall asleep.(Jaipur, India)




I came to the city when I was twenty-one because I wanted to meet my favorite actor. I thought that I’d wait outside his apartment, and he’d appear shirtless on his balcony just like in the Bollywood movies. But he never came out. I didn’t want to go home without meeting him because all my friends would laugh at me. So I slept on the streets. I had no money to survive. I began working at a bookstall just so I could eat. And every day after work I’d return to his house to see if I could find him. I finally got my chance when there was a big movie premiere. I knew he’d be there. I waited along the rope line and met all of the other actors. But when my favorite arrived, he walked past without greeting anyone. He didn’t even make eye contact. I was heartbroken. He didn’t even acknowledge his fans. At least now I have a bookshop. I can thank him for that. (Mumbai, India)




I love that she loves love." (Jaipur, India)




My sons used to protect me from my husband. He’s an alcoholic and he becomes violent when he drinks. He beat me so bad once that it injured my spine. My sons used to stand beside me. They’d try to stop it. They’d scream at him not to hit me. Then afterward they’d comfort me. But they’re teenagers now and they’re starting to go down the same path. They stay out drinking until 3 AM. I can’t get them to wake up in the morning. Today they got in a fight and one of them punched his fist through a window. There was blood everywhere. I came out here to calm down but my hands are still shivering. I don’t know what to do. I ask them to stop drinking but they won’t listen. There’s nothing left for me. I gave them life, I guess that’s all I can do.(Mumbai, India)




I didn’t get accepted into any of the universities that I wanted, and I ended up going to a lesser quality school. I hated being there. On the first day, I thought about buying a plane ticket and going home. I felt like I had nothing in common with the people around me. I felt like they belonged and I didn’t. My plan was just to survive get through six lectures a day, keep to myself, and get back to my dorm room as soon as possible. I didn’t even talk to my own roommate. I’m ashamed of it now. I was so rude and self-centered, and it ended up making me lonely and miserable. I felt depressed. I was barely sleeping. Then one night I overheard my roommate talking on the phone with her mother. And I could tell she was having family problems. After she hung up, we stayed up all night talking. I told her that I was having a hard time too. She became my best friend after that night. We’d have dinner together. Whenever I left the room, she’d ask me where I was going. It felt so good to have someone worry about me. It’s been an important six months for me. I’ve realized how much I need other people. By not valuing the people around me, I was only hurting myself.(Mumbai, India)




I'm trying to live my life without conflict so I don't say much." (Mumbai, India)




I was a full time housewife. I kept mostly to myself. I was a very shy person. Then one year a local school asked if I could volunteer to teach art to the children. Just one hour every day. I did such a good job that the next year they asked me to teach full time. My husband didn’t want me to do it. He said: ‘You told me it would just be one hour. But I told him: ‘I listened to you for twenty-five years, now it’s my turn to take the reins.’ I ended up teaching for fifteen years. I built such a good reputation that children came from other schools to join my class. The whole school threw a party when I retired. The children sang songs and danced. It just made me feel so special. Teaching was the best decision I ever made. Now I feel like I’ve done something positive with my life. (Mumbai, India)




I don't know how old I am." (Mumbai, India)




I resented my mother for the longest time. She was always affectionate. There’s nothing mean-spirited about her. But she has some sort of condition. I used to be embarrassed to bring friends over. She was always fidgeting. She couldn’t sit still. There were a lot of monologues, and often they didn’t make any sense. When I was young I didn’t realize it was mental illness. Especially because the subject is taboo in India. So I’d just get angry with her. I’d victimize myself and blame her for everything. But I’m older now, so I’m trying to be more patient. I’ve met a lot of people who don’t even have mothers. So I’ve stopped fighting it. I don’t nag her. I hug her more. And I listen to her, even if she doesn’t always make sense. (Mumbai, India)


My mom made me a birthday dress!"


When I was a child, it was up to me to feed our family because my father couldn't work. I had a job at a motorcycle repair shop. Everyone would sit at home and wait for me to make money. Once we almost ran out of food. We didn’t have a single rupee and there was nothing to eat. I could handle it, but I couldn’t bear the thought of my baby sister going to sleep hungry. I sat at my shop all day, praying for a customer. But nobody came. Then just as night was falling, a man drove up with a puncture in his tire. The price of the repair was three rupees. But when I was finished, the man handed me twenty rupees and drove away. I was able to buy two kilograms of rice. My entire life turned around that day. My shop became very busy. We were never hungry again. Even today I think about that man. I never saw his face. He changed not just my life, but the lives of my entire family. I wonder who he was. Sometimes I think it was God himself.(Mumbai, India)


I have a big book about tiger conservation, and I always knew that the ocean was in trouble. But I didn’t really become an environmentalist until I got to grade one. That’s when I thought of many interesting ways to help. Some things you can do are reduce waste, carpool more often, spread awareness, plant trees, not cut trees, cut carbon emissions, and reduce nuclear disposal. I’m too young to start nuclear disposal because it’s dangerous and I don’t have the proper gloves. But I do recycle and keep plants on my balcony.(Mumbai, India)




My mother’s friends say that I’m just like her. She died of breast cancer when I was two years old. I had to grow up fast because my father was always working and seldom around. I was doing my own laundry at the age of seven. I figured the puberty thing out on my own. During high school, I’d leave for entire weekends without my dad even asking where I’d been. Then one year at Thanksgiving, my aunt told me that my mother had left me a letter and a video. She got so angry when I told her I’d never gotten it. I confronted my Dad about it, and he said that he ‘remembered something like that.’ He drove me to a safety deposit box—but the box was empty. He couldn’t remember what happened. He had one job. One thing that would mean more to me than anything else, and he couldn’t do it. My mom’s friends always tell me: ‘She would be so proud of you,’ or ‘She was so in love with you. But that’s not the same. It’s not the same as something directly from her. Something she made especially for me. Just one thing that actually says: ‘This is how much I love you.’




I’m pretty sure I’m a sociopath. Or something close to it. My parents were pilots, so I spent most of my early childhood on a small island in Tunisia. The only other kids were the children of a local hotelkeeper. I was so isolated that I even invented my own words. By the time I got to high school, I was a monster. I only cared about being the best. I was a bully. I’d argue just for the sake of arguing. I would destroy any belief, just to be right. My behavior is different now. But I think I’m still a sociopath. I’m not sure I feel empathy. But I do always try to make the empathetic choice. It’s an intellectual thing for me. I’m intellectually convinced of the need for empathy. I choose to help other people. I choose to be a reliable friend. I have a wonderful wife who judges me by my actions, and not my reasons for them. Sometimes I feel like Pinocchio. Was he a real boy? Yes, because that’s what he always strived to be.




I was late to the delivery room when she was born. But as soon as I walked in, her eyes started tracking me. Like she knew I was her Dad. Even the nurses were laughing about it. She’s always been my road dog. She never went through a ‘teenage phase.’ She never stopped wanting to spend time with me. We could always talk about the problems she was having at school. Even as she got older, we’d still go to the park on Saturdays or find some exotic place to eat in Brooklyn. It’s a little tough now that she’s away at college. I miss spending time with her. But I trust her completely and I want her to enjoy these years. I just hope that when she falls in love with some dude, I’ll still get to see her.




Saturn is leaving Sagittarius and moving into Capricorn today. Things that may have been otherwise will now become reality. The time for talking and thinking is over. Now is the time to do.




Being famous won't be easy because I'll have to sing in front of a lot of people, and I get nervous. But I already sang in front of eleven people in music class. And I made a video on my mom's phone that eighty-two people watched on Instagram."


A really bad divorce triggered the first and only manic episode of my life. It was my body’s attempt to avoid feeling any pain. I was sleeping three hours a night and doing handstands in the morning. I did a whole lot of writing. I’m a contractor so I taught myself all sorts of plastering techniques and developed an entire series of finishes. I worked as a carpenter for twelve hours every day. Eventually I pushed myself to the point where I injured my shoulder, and the doctor told me that I couldn’t work anymore. It forced me to slow down, confront the illness, and make friends with that part of myself. Now I’m on a mood stabilizer. I’m not operating in a triggered state anymore. And I’m back to work, but this time with a team of people to help me carry the load.




I'm still having trouble even saying the word "divorce.' I had always planned on only being married once. And now I’m not. I’m getting older now, and I always wanted to be a Mom but I’m not. And that’s really hard. The house feels so empty. It still looks like two people live in it. I’m clocking my progress by the moments I’m not crying. And as long as I don’t think about any of these things I’m fine. My career is going great. I can choose to not think about it. But I’ve got to. I’ve got to ask myself: ‘What happens if he never apologizes?’ , ‘Will I be fine if he never make amends?’ I’d rather not think about this stuff because it hurts. But I know it’s the only way to move on. I can either think through it now, or I can carry it with me forever.




My husband had a sudden heart attack a few months ago. It was just a few blocks from here. They called me in to identify his body and then just let me walk right out onto 7th Avenue. I felt so lost. My friends were wonderful and supportive but eventually everyone moves on with their lives. I don’t have children. And I’m not a workaholic. So I was left with this intense loneliness and void. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t sleep. Then one day I started researching dogs that are good for grief and depression. And ‘poodle’ kept popping up. But when I went to the rescue fair, all the poodles were gone. There was this one old dog in the back that nobody was looking at. She was skin and bones. She was trembling and scared and mucus was running out of her eyes. She seemed so fragile. She reminded me of myself. I named her Grace because I think my husband sent her to me. She’s my first dog. She’s been pure joy. We spend all our time together. She’s gained her weight back. She comes with me to therapy. We’re getting better together.


I grew up on a reservation because my father was Cherokee. The only thing he believed in was destroying things. When I was five years old, he sat me down on the couch and said: ‘You’re going to become a man the same way I did.’ First he made me smoke a Camel unfiltered cigarette. Then he gave me a shot of ‘corn stalk hooch.’ It’s liquor made from the silky stuff at the top of corn. Most adults can’t handle it, let alone a kid. It took me a whole day to finish. Every time I threw it up, he’d pour another one. My mistake was that I kept trying to smoke the cigarette first. You’ve got to drink the liquor first so it numbs your throat.




I moved to Havana after September 11th. I opened up the first English language bookstore. It’s been great, but living there has been a major challenge to my introversion. When I lived in New York, I could choose to not interact with people. But that’s not really an option in Cuba. Introversion isn’t really ‘a thing.’ If you’re alone, then something must be wrong. Birthdays are the worst. My friends make me have a party every year. I’ve got to have one slice of cake before I’m allowed to go home. And I have this 86-year-old neighbor named Terasita that always assumes I’m lonely and brings me fritters. I resisted at first because I really value my alone time. I’d lock the doors. I’d turn off the lights. But resistance is futile. They’re so persistent.


I almost married my high school sweetheart. She was a sharp girl. Very kind. Long brown hair, slim the whole package. We moved to California together after graduation. We spent all our time together. We were in love. We even talked about marriage several times. Then one morning she decided she didn’t want to do it anymore. She told me things had changed. It destroyed me. Ever since then, she’s been the one that I’ve always wondered about. I actually saw her a couple years ago. She came to New York for her father’s funeral, and we took a walk in Central Park together. I hadn’t seen her in forty-five years. She looked amazing. Exactly the same as I remembered. She had two kids. She’d gotten married to some guy from Yale. Toward the end of our walk, she told me that if she could do it all over again, she probably would have never married the guy. I said: ‘That breaks my heart, because all these years I imagined you were happy.’ Of course, there might have been a small part of me that was thinking: ‘Haha! You married the wrong guy.’




I just moved to New York, so it’s been a little tough meeting people. It seems like everyone already has their own group of friends. So I’m trying to become more of a ‘yes’ person and do things I normally wouldn’t do. Like I came to the park today instead of sitting at home. And I went to my first hockey game yesterday. And I joined a dodge ball team on Thursday nights. Dodge ball is a lot more pressure than I thought it would be. I try to hang back and not throw the ball, but then usually I’m the last one and everyone is aiming at me. The only consolation is knowing that it’s going to be over in two seconds. And after the game we all go to the bar. Our team name is ‘We Throw Things and Drink.’




The bridge to Rikers Island is called the Bridge of Pain. You’re on this bus. You see the city behind you. And in front of you, you see nothing but four walls. I was sent there for a year when I was nineteen years old. My friends and I got caught stealing copper pipes from a construction site. All of us grew up together. I thought they had my back. But none of them came to see me in prison. I had zero visits. Nobody put money in my account. So I haven’t talked to any of those guys since I got out. I work two jobs now. I stay out of trouble. I’m trying not to be a negative person anymore. I still have anger problems. I think it’s because there was so much yelling and violence in my house growing up. But whenever I feel the anger coming on, I just close my eyes and rub my ears. My baby brothers used to rub my ears when I was growing up. When things got bad in the house it always used to calm me down.




I want to be a comedian. A lot of people in my class think I’m funny. Sometimes it can be hard to think of a good joke that isn’t about Trump. But even if you don’t get any laughs, you can usually just keep silent for a few minutes and try again. Sometimes I accidentally make jokes that only I get. Like the other day I tried to tell a joke about that lady who handed out cashews instead of candy for Halloween. But only my friend Aiden knew about the Cashew Lady so nobody laughed. But then later my teacher asked where I got my sources for my constitutional rights paper. And I told her I got them from ‘a sorcerer.’ Even she laughed at that one.




A lot of younger people pass by me while I’m running. It’s a bit of a metaphor for the rest of my life. I turned forty-seven in October. I’m starting to have bosses that are younger than me. It’s causing me to question what my experience is worth. I’m noticing that my younger colleagues are more adventurous and take more risks—either because they don’t know about failure or they don’t care. As I get older, I feel like more and more of my life is outside my control. That’s why I started training for the marathon. I want to be in control of something. I can’t control current events. I can’t control politics. I can’t even control my personal relationships. But I can control my legs. I can put one leg in front of the other. I can decide the miles that I run each day, each week, each month. And it feels great. I get a rush every time I make it to the top of a hill."




We had our son through a surrogate, so we didn’t get to watch the pregnancy day-by-day. We didn’t see the stomach getting bigger. We didn’t have the same sort of emotional preparation as traditional parents. It’s like one day we weren’t parents, and then the next day we are. He was born two weeks early so we had to quickly jump on a flight. But we got to the hospital late. We actually met our son for the first time in an elevator. We were heading up to the room, and the nurses were bringing him up from the nursery. They noticed two guys carrying luggage, and said: ‘I think this might be your son!’




She originally said she didn’t want kids. And I originally told her I was completely fine with that. But that was a lie. I guess I just thought we’d grow into the idea. She also told me that she never wanted to get married—and she changed her mind about that. So I thought she'd change her mind about a child too. Honestly, I would be disappointed if we didn’t have one. I think something magic happens when you open your heart to another living thing. But I don’t want her to make a decision for my sake. So maybe the solution is just to be disappointed. Maybe I’m just selfish. But I value our time together. And I want to continue spending time on ourselves. Plus I just don’t feel very maternal. I’m afraid that I’ll convince myself for his sake, and I’ll will myself to believe that I want a child, but then I won’t feel that connection. But he will. And then it will be the two of them and me.




I normally don’t tell people I’m a Christian because they assume you’re a zealot, or parochial, or close-minded. And I don’t think I’m any of those things. I go to a progressive church. We bring in great speakers and do a lot of volunteering. My religion is just a centering part of my life. It gives me guideposts. It gives me a code of ethics and helps me see dignity in other people. Sure, there’s a storybook nature to it. And it can be a shame that people focus so much on the story. I'd rather focus on the message the story conveys.




I work at a disposable razor factory. We used to have seven hundred workers. There were lines of people down conveyor belts. Now there’s only four hundred left, and most of those are just temporary. Machines do everything now. Anything that required hands, at least. We used to look at the razors through microscopes trying to find imperfections. Now the computer just takes a picture. Even the forklifts drive themselves. Soon there will be nobody left. People are just too expensive. You can’t stop it. I tried my own little protest for a while. I told myself that I wasn’t going to buy any of the cheap stuff from Wal-Mart. But that didn’t last long. I couldn’t afford anything else.




I’ve been at the same company for nine years. I should have moved up by now. But I’ve just never been good at office politics. I assumed my work ethic and performance would be enough. But some people are just better at getting recognized. They ingratiate themselves with the boss. They have no problem taking credit for other people’s work. They’ll diminish your accomplishments and inflate their own. I’d never go that far. But I’m not waiting to get noticed anymore. If I beat a deadline, solve a tough problem, or get great feedback from a customer—I’m copying upper management on the email.




My husband is running for city council in Long Beach and it's been a difficult race. His name is Joseph Naham. He didn't get many contributions or media coverage because he's running as a Green Party candidate. He's optimistic, because that's who he is, but there's a chance he might be a bit hurt by the results tonight. So I got him these flowers to thank him. He put his whole heart into the race. This wasn't a power play for him. He genuinely wanted to help the community. I just want him to know that no matter what happens, he's planting seeds, and they're gonna grow, and that's what it's all about."




I just tried to go on my first run post-wedding. I wanted to make it three miles but I couldn't do it. Toward the end I tried switching my soundtrack from techno to gospel, but I still had to stop. Too much eating during the honeymoon. You should have seen me on the wedding day, though. All that hard work paid off. That tux fit like lotion."




I had an awakening on a balcony in Seattle. I was listening to soul music on my Walkman. And I was paying attention to the music. And suddenly I realized that I was the attention itself. I realized that I’m not my mind—I’m the awareness of my mind. We’re all just drops of consciousness and if you get to the point where you can turn around and see your drop, you’ll discover that it’s connected to an ocean of consciousness. And then you’ll be illumined. I don’t care if anyone believes me. I’m not trying to convert anyone. There’s nothing to convert because everyone is exactly where they’re supposed to be right now.




You know how when you see a group of geese in a field, and there’s always one with its head up, looking around? That’s me. I was always afraid. Just anxious. It’s like my mind was a heat-seeking missile, always honing in on what could possibly go wrong. My first daughter got the brunt of it. I was so worried about everything. Her first plane ride. Her first day of school. Her first sleepover. I thought if I anticipated every little thing that might go wrong, then maybe I could fend things off. But that’s never possible. Things will always go wrong. The best you can do is give your kids self-confidence. But I’m afraid I passed on my anxiety instead. Because when Mom is always afraid of the world, the world becomes something to fear.




We met five years ago in the comment section of our Wordpress blogs. I was living in the Philippines. I randomly discovered his blog and commented on a post about how much he can eat in one sitting. Then it became one ongoing conversation for three years. We began our relationship on August 24th 2013 when I wrote ‘I love you’ in an email. We talked every day, but we didn’t even meet in person until two years later when he came to visit me in the Philippines. He proposed the very first day. We stopped working on our old blogs and created one together called Two Bees In A Blog.




I found out on my 21st birthday that my dad was leaving my mom. At first I was angry with him. It seemed extremely selfish. But when I finally agreed to talk to him, he told me that he’d been depressed for five years. He told me that he’d felt trapped in his life and his marriage. He even told me that one night he drove out to a bridge, thought about killing himself, and only changed his mind at the last minute. Part of me empathizes with him. I never realized he was hiding this depression from us. But at the same time he made choices that really hurt our family. So I’m trying to figure out what blame he deserves. At what point is a person with mental illness still responsible for their choices?

It was a tsunami. In April of ’82 there was an article in the New York Times about a new gay cancer, and everyone thought ‘oh well.’ I was in my twenties. I wasn’t worried about a thing. But then every week you started to hear about somebody becoming ill. My boss was one of the first. He was a famous florist. He went into the hospital on Thanksgiving and was dead by Easter. I lost most of my friends. A lot of the first men to die were privileged. They were closeted, corporate white men. During the day they were bankers but at night they’d hit the leather clubs and bars. But they learned their privilege didn’t matter after they got sick. They were just ‘gay.’ We had to fight for AIDS to be recognized by the government. We joined together with people of color, and junkies, and prostitutes. It was a beautiful thing, really. Our feminist lesbian sisters taught us how to protest because they’d been doing it for decades. They showed us how to organize meetings, and bring people together, and force the government to the table—things we’d never had to think about as white men.

At first I told myself I could get past it. I said, ‘Let’s just see how it goes.’ We had excellent dates. Everything else about her was exactly what I wanted. I didn’t want to ruin something good for that one little reason. But it’s been 1.5 years. And I feel horrible, but I just can’t get past it. And I feel like a bad person for being bothered by it. I can’t bring myself to tell her. We’re going to couple’s therapy next week, but I still don’t think I’ll be able to say it. Is there any right way to ask someone to lose weight for you?


Zoe loves the movies. So I knew if I was going to propose, it had to involve the movies. But I can’t make a movie myself because I don’t work in film. So I had to get creative. I ordered a black-and-white Italian film from a vintage film dealer. It seemed vaguely romantic. I spent four months editing it on my computer. I changed all the subtitles. I cut out the harem scene. I completely changed the plot so that it resembled our lives. I wrote some dialogue about picture frames because Zoe’s family owns a frame shop. And I love trains. So I made the main character a train enthusiast. When I finished the editing, I rented out a small theater with sixty seats. I invited all of Zoe’s friends and family. I made sure everyone sat in the front and didn’t turn around. The weather was beautiful that day. Zoe didn’t want to go to a movie. We got in a big fight about it, but I finally convinced her. I was so nervous that I laughed during the whole film. I’d seen all the jokes 1000 times but I laughed at them anyway. Then during the final scene, the main characters started speaking to the audience, and one of them asked: ‘Does anyone here want to get married?’ So I stood up. The lights came on. All her friends and family turned around. And I gave a speech that I prepared. I was so nervous that I forgot to ask the actual question. But Zoe bailed me out and said ‘yes’ anyway.




My mom went off when she found out I was gay. It’s not accepted in Jamaican culture. I had to pretend I was ‘over it’ just so I could stay in the house. I didn’t really have anyone to talk to about it. I was always getting in fights with other kids. I didn’t even have a real friend until I was seventeen. I joined my school’s volleyball team, and the coach paired me up with a boy named Winnie to work on drills. I was still in the closet. He was much more flamboyant than me. He’d make me laugh. We’d talk about other boys on the team. He showed me how to not take myself so seriously. And we had similar backgrounds too. Winnie lived in a single parent home. His mother didn’t accept his lifestyle either. Sometimes we’d talk on the phone at night. Or we’d get a slice of pizza after practice. These were things that I’d never done with anyone before. I never pursued anything romantic because I couldn’t risk the friendship. It was the first time I didn’t feel alone.




I came to America when I was six years old. Mom said she brought us here so that we’d have opportunities in life. She said that back in the Bahamas, it’s only the ‘haves’ and the ‘have nots.’ She wanted us to have more choices. But I don’t think she fully understood how things work here. She was a news reporter back in the Bahamas. But the only job she could get here was taking care of oldpeople. My dad could only work construction. We moved to four different states just so they could find work. They always told me, ‘Just study hard in school and everything will work out fine.’ So that was my plan. I got all A’s up until the 11th grade except for one B in math. My goal was to get top twenty in my class, then go to college, then get a degree, and then get a job. I realized the truth my senior year. My guidance counselor told me I couldn’t get a loan. I couldn’t get financial aid. Even if I could find a way to pay for school, I probably couldn’t get a job. I felt so mad at everyone. There were some kids who completely slacked off in school, but even they were going to college. I started having panic attacks. My dad told me not to worry. He called me a ‘doubting Peter.’ He invited all his friends over to a fish fry to help raise money. And he did get $3,000. But that wasn’t enough. So I searched really hard on the Internet and found the Dream.us scholarship. My mom was so excited when I got it. They’re paying for me to go to Queens College. Now my mom’s really scared again because DACA got revoked. She’s crying all the time at work. I try to tell her that no matter what happens, we’re not going to die. We just might have to start over.




I was on a leadership team in 5th grade. At the end of the year we were supposed to take a trip to Washington DC. We held fundraisers and everything. But when it was time to go, I didn’t have the identification papers to buy a plane ticket. So our teacher Ms. Rivera decided that we’d take a bus. Just so I could go too. That trip changed my life. It made me want to be a lawyer. And Ms. Rivera became one of the closest people in my life. She always kept in touch. She basically watched me grow up. One time in high school I got in a huge fight with my mom, and Ms. Rivera came and took me on a long car ride. I started to tell her everything. I told her about a recent break-up, and how I smoked weed, and ‘I did this,’ and ‘I did that.’ She just listened to everything. Then she started telling me about her life too. She told me that she’d been in an abusive relationship. I’d always thought her life was perfect because she was a guidance counselor. But she’d been through so much too. When it was came time to apply for college, Ms. Rivera was the one who helped me apply for DACA. She told me about the TheDream.us scholarship. I didn’t even want to apply. I was ready to give up. I’d just accepted that I’d always work in restaurants like my mom. But Ms. Rivera made me apply. She said: ‘What happened to that girl who wanted to be a lawyer?’ I learned that I got the scholarship in February. They're paying for my entire college. Ms. Rivera was so proud of me. She kept saying: ‘I told you so.’




I was just a year old when my family came from Ecuador. My parents were always open with me about it. Even from a young age. I was lucky that way a lot of undocumented kids don’t find out the truth until they’re much older. Their parents never tell them because they want them to feel normal. So the kids grow up thinking that they’re 100 percent American. Then they try to study abroad, or apply to colleges, and they find out they don’t have the papers. And it hits them hard. It’s like they’ve got to figure themselves out all over again. They learn that they aren’t a part of the culture they grew up in. And they start to feel a sense of shame. Nobody ever talks about it. They’re too afraid. I certainly never told anyone. That’s why DACA was so interesting. It gave us the smallest amount of safety. People started to step out of the shadows, and say ‘I’m here.’ We began to find each other. Now there’s a community. And we’re speaking out together. We grew up in this culture. We grew up with the same kids as everyone else. This is our home.




We were pretty poor back in Mexico. My parents were divorced. Mom did the best she could. She was always a hustler. She’d sell jewelry, or food, or anything that she could. But a lot of nights there still wouldn’t be enough to eat. We’d survive on tortillas and salt. I was only eight when we came to America. So I was too young to understand. I think my mom thought she could make some money and bring us home. She thought she’d learn English, and maybe start a business. But it was so much harder than she expected. We moved so much looking for work. She’s fifty and she still cleans houses every day. Every year she gets more worn down. She’s been getting sick a lot lately. But she can’t afford to stop. She never will. Right now I’m in school. I always thought I had to be the best student because I’m undocumented. I thought I’d go to law school, or graduate school. But now I’m not so sure. My mom would literally destroy her body to make that happen for me. How could I allow that to happen? I’m a Dreamer. And everyone loves the Dreamers because we’re a perfect package to sell. But why am I the only one who gets the chance to feel safe? Whenever I hear ‘I stand with Dreamers,’ I always think about my mom. I’m not willing to throw her under the bus. I'm not willing to be a bargaining chip to make her seem like a criminal. Everything people admire about Dreamers is because of our parents.


I got divorced when I was sixty-four. We had a good run. We were married for 36 years. We’re not enemies. We just outgrew each other. When the kids were in the house, all our focus was on them. But after they left, there just wasn’t any reason to keep doing it. We were just living our own lives—together. Neither of us was all that interested in changing. So what’s the point in staying together? If you talk to most people my age, and they’re really being honest, they’ll tell you that they’re dissatisfied with their partner. But then they’ll shrug their shoulders and say: ‘Where else am I going to go?’ Because most people can’t stand to be alone. My ex-wife and I never had that problem.




My first time was October 18th, 2013. I was a freshman in college. I was alone in my dorm room and I’d just eaten a bunch of Halloween candy. So I purged it. I felt great afterward. I thought I’d discovered a new tool. It seemed like a way to stop gaining weight. But it became very powerful, very quickly. My second time was two days later. Soon it became most meals. I became addicted to watching the numbers drop. I lost all power over it. I was dizzy and depressed all the time. I couldn’t focus in class or go out with friends. For five months, I lost all control. Then I finally got help. I started talking about it. And the more I talked about it, the more control I got back. The eating disorder lost its power when it stopped being a secret. I’m much better now, but I’ll always be recovering. A few weeks ago I had a relapse. It was the first time in months. Even though I was disappointed, I reminded myself that it wasn’t the end of the world. I haven’t lost all the progress I’ve made over the past four years. I just need to stay positive. And keep talking about it.




My mother was sixteen when the war came to St. Petersburg. She was the oldest of four children, so her parents chose to evacuate her first. She was supposed to find a job and the rest of the family would follow. She was evacuated with a factory. The workers were on one boat and the machinery was on the other. The boat with the machinery was bombed and sank to the bottom of the river. My mother ended up in a city thousands of miles away. Sometimes there was such little food that she survived on grass. But everyone who stayed behind in the city died. Her entire family was killed in one night. Growing up, she always told us about St. Petersburg. She hung paintings of the city all over our house. So we wanted to bring her back here before she died. When we arrived in the city, we went straight to visit her old house. Only the foundation was left. But when we got off at the subway stop, the strangest thing happened. Two children came running toward us. Their mother was calling after them: ‘Sonya and Misha!’ They had the same names as me and my brother. It was as if they were greeting us.(St. Petersburg, Russia)


I met him six months ago at work. I’m the manager of a store. He was a delivery man. He was playful and fun. He’d bring me coffee and buns in the morning. He started driving me home at night. We began dating and recently moved in together. But a few weeks ago I called his cell phone and a woman picked up. She started asking who I was, and said she wanted to know why I was calling ‘her man.’ Afterwards he told me it was a big misunderstanding. He said it was his ex-girlfriend, and he’d been with her for nine years, so he still feels a responsibility to provide for her. He swears it’s just a material relationship. But she calls him all the time now. He’s not my property, and I don’t want to lose him, but I just want him to make her go away. But he acts like it’s my problem. When I tell him it bothers me, he just says: ‘I’ll ask her not to call at night.’ (St. Petersburg, Russia)




She needed people around us and I didn’t understand that. I was locked on the two of us. There was a Russian writer who wrote: ‘I hated the world so that I could love you more.’ And that was me. I stopped talking to my old friends. I stopped spending time with people from work. And I wanted her to do the same. I was jealous, maybe. She was much younger than me so that made me feel insecure. I don’t think I wasn’t being mean. I was just asking her not to go to work parties. She left me 258 days ago. We’d just come back from a holiday by the sea, and everything seemed fine. It was just like always. We were swimming, drinking wine, going to cafes. I had no idea it was coming. One morning we were having coffee in the kitchen, and she said: ‘I don’t love you anymore.’ It was two months straight of drinking vodka after that. I lost thirty pounds. Only now is the wound starting to heal. I’m getting used to being lonely. (Moscow, Russia)




I don’t get to live the life of a seventeen year old. My mom is always working and I have a six-year-old brother. So I have to do everything that a mother would do. I take him to kindergarten, pick him up, feed him, clean up after him. I don’t get to take breaks. I can’t play sports after school. I can’t get extra tutoring. But it’s not my mom’s fault. She’s trying to save money for me to go to college. And she tells me every day that I’m a wonderful daughter. But it’s been very difficult for me. The only good thing is that I can understand adult problems already. I don’t take anything for granted and I know that life is not easy. It seems like my friends aren’t even studying to get knowledge. They’re studying to get an allowance. So I think I’m more mature than most seventeen year olds. But at some point I would like some time to take care of myself. Or maybe even have someone take care of me for a change.(Moscow, Russia)




I’m trying to undo old patterns. If she does something that was prohibited in my own childhood, I automatically react. It comes from inside of me. So if we need to go somewhere, and she’s resisting, and I feel like yelling, I’ll turn it into a game. I’ll be the mother cat, and she’ll be the kitten. Or we’ll both be princesses going on an adventure. Honestly, I think the pretending helps me more than it helps her. It’s what forces me out of those patterns.(Moscow, Russia)




I graduated more than one thousand kids from elementary school. I'd still be teaching but my eyes went bad. It’s such an important time in a child’s life. It’s when they learn speech, grammar, and how to pay attention. It’s when the tree gets its roots. If you’re taught wrong in elementary school, you’ll be trying to catch that train for the rest of your life. (St. Petersburg, Russia)




My daughter was injured during birth. Her back was broken during labor. She’s in her thirties now but she still has a lot of problems, especially in her mind. She can’t be left alone. Sometimes she doesn’t even know where she is. It’s like she’s living in a ghost world. It’s been very difficult for us. My wife had to stop working and became severely depressed. We can’t travel. We can’t be active. I try not to resent my daughter but it can be hard. Sometimes she gets very aggressive. When she was younger, she threw all of our possessions out the window. I don’t think many people could have handled it. They’d have taken her to an institution by now. But I can’t do it. Those places are very scary. But my wife and I are getting old. We have no other relatives. So that’s where she’ll end up one day. I try not to imagine it. But it’s inevitable.(St. Petersburg, Russia)




I’m fourteen and all my friends are crazy about being grown ups right now. They’re drinking alcohol. They’re smoking cigarettes. They’re trying to act vulgar. They’ll do anything to separate from their parents and prove that they’re independent. Personally, I’d like to be a child just a little bit longer. I love spending time with my parents. I’m not in a rush to get away. I’d like these times to last as long as possible. (St. Petersburg, Russia)




We met six months ago at a dance night. His wife passed away three years ago. I’d been married for thirty years and gotten divorced. It was just nice to have someone to talk to. We have so much in common. My ex-husband only wanted to stay home and watch TV. But we do all sorts of things together: walk around the city, go to museums, travel. Have sex.Hush.What? We’re still young.(St. Petersburg, Russia)


It wasn’t an official marriage. We didn’t register. But we had a plan. I was earning good money even though I was young. I was already a specialist at the age of nineteen. She was very beautiful. We’d been together for four years. She was a good person and very easy to talk to. She’d met my family and everyone loved her. At the time I was helping to construct a new subway line in Moscow. I came home from work one day and she was gone. There were no cell phones back then. Nobody knew where she was. She’d last been seen getting into a private taxi with her friend Natalya. A lot of people were disappearing during that time. The police stopped searching after a few months. She wasn't seen again. There’s a line from a Russian poem. It says: ‘We love just once in a lifetime. And spend the rest of our lives looking for something similar.’ I’ve had other girlfriends after Oksana. But I don’t remember their birthday. Oksana’s birthday was July 9th. She was a Leo.(St. Petersburg, Russia)


I quit my job earlier this year. I’m taking a little time to focus on myself. I worked from nine to six everyday. I often brought my work home with me. I was getting sick, and anxious, and I wasn’t sleeping well. But I could never accept my weaknesses. I’d see other people working harder than me, and I’d think: ‘If they can do it, why should I feel tired?’ Eventually I pushed myself so hard that I became depressed. One reason I couldn’t slow down is because my entire family is hard working. Both my parents are architects. My grandfather is an engineer. The importance of hard work has been passed down through the generations. I think the entire country is afraid to stop working. There have been so many hard times. There’s been so much hunger. For so long we had to work all the time just to survive. Even though things are better now, that’s a difficult to psychology to escape. I’m starting to interview for new jobs. But I’m asking different questions. Money is the last thing I worry about. I’m much more interested in the schedule. (St. Petersburg, Russia)


I came here to meet a girl that I know from the Internet. She's coming all the way from Belarus. It's nothing sexual. Just a friendship. Her name is Olga. We’ve known each other for seven years but this is the first time we’re meeting in person. She’s supported me through a lot of hard times. I get bullied a lot. People at my school often call me names and try to start fights with me. They send love letters to other guys in my name. Olga has comforted me a lot. She checks in with me throughout the day. She says things like: ‘You don’t deserve it.’ And ‘Don’t pay attention to them.’ Her messages have really helped me get through the last few years even if they were just words on the Internet.(St. Petersburg, Russia)


We were together for nine years. I was completely dependent on him. He was a strong and powerful man and he expected obedience. If he called me at 4 AM, and told me to meet him in Moscow, I was expected to go to the train station. He had a very strong energy. It was hard to argue with him. In the beginning of the relationship, I obeyed because of the pressure. But then the pressure just became a habit. It got worse as time went on. Eventually he stopped listening to me completely. I became so lonely. When you’re with someone who doesn’t care about your views, and has no desire to understand you, it’s worse than being alone. I still loved him though. I knew that he’d had a hard life. I told myself that I had to make sacrifices to build a family. But one morning I woke up and decided that I couldn’t do it anymore. If I stayed in the relationship, I would lose myself completely. I remember it was raining that morning. There was mud in the streets. And something told me: ‘Today is the day.’ That was two years ago. I’ve spent these last two years learning to be alone. I’m realizing the things that I like to do. I feel better, I look better, and I’ve been sharing more of myself with others. I feel like I’m finally learning who I am. (St. Petersburg, Russia)




I’m ninety but I feel like I’m fifty. I don’t take any medicine. I never complain. I’m just happy to be alive. I tell people: ‘Start with what you have, not with what you want.’ Every day I dance for two hours. And I’m still really interesting too. I love politics and literature. I love the sciences. And I’ve got a boyfriend named Alexander. We exchange books. I don’t even know how old he is. (Moscow, Russia)




My father died in his sleep last year. Right after my birthday. I didn’t have a good relationship with him. He left the family when I was ten. We had good moments but we were never really close. I wanted him to understand me. I wanted him to realize that I needed support, and love, and somebody to take care of me. I needed him to say ‘I’m sorry.’ But he never did. Whenever we talked, all he cared about was getting across his side of the story. And then he died. And now I have to forgive someone who can’t say ‘I’m sorry.’ I feel like I’m playing this game of chess. And I have to keep making moves, or nothing will ever change. Except that there’s nobody sitting across from me anymore. And I can only guess the moves that he’d make.(St. Petersburg, Russia)




There are always two little beautiful humans looking at me like I'm the most important thing in the world. They copy everything I do, especially my son. I’m very careful how I treat my wife because I know that’s how he’ll learn to treat women. I call my wife pet names, and my son started calling his sister those same names. Recently I picked flowers for my wife. And the next day he picked flowers for his sister. (Moscow, Russia)




I’ve worked in the circus my entire life. I studied to be a clown for many years. A great clown can make you see your own clumsiness. There are many famous clowns. Einstein was a clown. I always think of that famous picture of Einstein sticking out his tongue. That is a sign of extreme intelligence. Dumb people are always working on their serious face. They think a serious face will make them seem intelligent. But intelligent people don't need a serious face.(Moscow, Russia)




I was only eighteen when my first daughter was born. Her name was Svetlana. She came down with an infection but there were no antibiotics in the hospital. I begged the doctors and nurses to tell me where to buy them. But none of them would tell me because they were afraid to go to jail. I finally found some American medicine on the black market. But weeks had already passed and it was too late. The antibiotics didn’t work and my daughter passed away. Up until that moment, I had considered becoming an artist or a dancer. But I decided then to become a doctor. (Moscow, Russia)


I’m afraid I’ll live a useless life and nobody will remember me. I don’t feel a strong interest toward anything. If I do, it’s just a momentary thing, and then I drop it. I tried acting. I tried swimming. I tried dancing. But I got bored with all of it. If I don’t choose something soon then I’ll leave nothing behind. We only have a certain amount of energy in life. If you don’t put it somewhere then it’s wasted. I feel like one of the little yellow minions from that movie. They get sad if they don’t have a villain to serve. When I have a goal, and I’m moving toward it, and I reach it, then I feel a little relief. That’s what life is to me. A series of goals that you move toward. I don’t think it’s possible to just become happy. Life’s not that easy. But if you keep moving, you can forget that you’re sad. (Moscow, Russia)


I cut my hair the other day. It used to be down to my waist. It’s a personal experiment. I’m trying to prove to myself that I can have short hair and still be feminine. It can be hard when I step out on the street and all the other women have long hair. I think a lot of people see short hair, and form an idea that I hate men, or that I only think about business. But I still feel feminine inside. I guess I want to prove that feeling has nothing to do with the type of attention I’m getting.(Moscow, Russia)


This is a picture of me before I lost my job. It was only a year ago but I barely recognize that person now. I was thirty pounds heavier. I was much more confident. It felt like a guardian angel was guiding my steps. Things always seemed to work out for me. Now it seems like my guardian angel is drunk. Now I look at this picture and see a man who’s wearing a mask. The man in the picture wants to be seen as a person who does important things. He wants to be seen as confident, and harsh, and a leader. He wants to be seen as an attorney. Now I just want to be seen as a person. Someone who’s calm. Who’s balanced. Who loves his friends and family. And who’s kind. (Moscow, Russia)




Today in microfashion(Moscow, Russia)


I’m the lead singer in this band because he can’t hear very well. But I’d like to say that he’s a wonderful man. You should have seen him when we met in 1953. Green eyes. Black hair. A little gray on the side. All my girlfriends were so jealous. He had no money so he sold his best suit to buy me fruit and flowers. I used to get entire letters from him that were written in verse. He still writes in verse but just little notes now. I think he might have run out of verse.(Moscow, Russia)


I’ve sold thousands of pieces of latex in my life and I’m a doyen of the fetish scene. I love to get people from ‘here’ to ‘there.’ ‘Here’ is having a fetish and hiding it. ‘There’ is exploring it. Trust me, your dark secret is nothing I haven’t heard before. It’s nothing to be ashamed of. It’s just what you’re into. And there’s plenty of other people who are into the same thing. You should never feel shame. Unless of course shame gets you off.




I have four boys. I was a single mother for most of my life. But I’ve been a good mother. I’m going to pat myself on the back for that. It wasn’t easy. I struggled hard. In my twenties, I got kicked out on the street with four young kids. But I made sure they were always safe, fed, sheltered, and had proper clothes for the season. They always had bikes and skates. And I kept them busy. I signed them up for everything: karate, basketball, swimming, you name it. I paid for it all. I didn’t want them spending time in the streets, so I’d work overtime just to keep them busy. I never had much left over for myself. I sacrificed a lot for them. I still wake up at 3:30 every morning to beat the traffic across the bridge. But they always come first. Because they never asked to come here. They were my decision.




My mother had always been functional as long as she took her medicine. But a couple years ago I began to notice a change. When we spoke on the phone, she’d laugh at the smallest things. Everything was a joke to her. But then she could also get very angry. She became convinced that people were plotting against her. She kicked all my siblings out of the house. When I went home to California, I discovered that she had drawn lines and circles inside all of her books. She seemed fixated on certain times and dates. Everything bothered her. She started calling me ‘faggot’ and things like that. It’s been a tough two years. She’s gotten worse and worse. I’ve flown back to California four times, but we barely speak when I'm home. It’s like she’s not even there. Meanwhile I’ve stopped investing in my friendships. I’ve had to drop out of my dance company. I’ve been getting depressed. Even when I’m not with her, I’m worrying about her. It’s getting to the point where I have to choose not to care about this. I have to think of her as gone. I didn’t create this. I created my life. And I don’t think I can take care of us both.


I always wanted to be a mental health therapist.  Ever since high school, I've enjoyed encouraging people and giving them hope.  But I lost my way.  I got caught in a world of addiction.  I lost ten years of my life to drugs.  I stopped when I became pregnant with my child, but by that time it was too late to go back to school.  I started working as an office manager.  I never completely lost my dream.  But I just put it on a shelf for thirty years.  Then five years ago I took it off the shelf.  I heard a lady in my choir talking about how she enrolled in community college.  I drove there the very next day.  I was so nervous when I filled out the application.  I was so nervous the first day of class.  All the old voices were telling me: ‘You never finish anything.’  But I said ‘fuck you’ to the old voices.  And I started getting A’s.  On my first test, I got the only perfect score in the class.  I graduated at the age of 50.  I got my Masters at 55.  And just last night I completed a mental health first aid course.  I’m so close now.  There’s still fear there.  I used to be afraid of it never happening.  Now I’m afraid of it happening.  The old voices try to come back sometimes.  They tell me: ‘You can rest,’ or ‘You’ve earned a break.’  But I’m not stopping this time.  Somebody out there is waiting for me to finish because they need my help.


Both my wife and I were raised in Guyana. Neither of our families demonstrated much affection. Physical contact was always reserved for discipline. There was a certain harshness in our household that I believe was passed down from slavery. Slaves were always punished for showing affection. They were never allowed to bond. And the effects of that have been passed down through the generations.My wife and I aren’t passionate people. We don’t express our feelings. We don’t say ‘I love you.’ We just banter back and forth. But now she’s sick with a major diagnosis. I’ve had to do everything for her: the shopping, the cooking, the housework. I try to be as responsive as possible to her needs. It’s the only way I know to show her that I care and I feel and I hurt.


First grade will be more harder than kindergarten cause I won't know how to write all the words."
My older brother was my hero growing up.  Everyone called him ‘Jise.’  He was this hip-hop dude.  People loved him, especially the girls.  Everyone knew when he walked into a room.  I was the opposite.  I blended into the crowd.  I was quiet.  I made straight A’s.  I liked comic books and action figures.  So I always looked up to him.  He was murdered one night in 1989.  Somebody shot him.  I was fifteen at the time, and I just kind of gave up.  I thought our family was cursed.  I always had this feeling that I was up next.  So it was like, ‘What’s the point of being good?’  I dropped out of school.  I started hanging out with the wrong crowd.  We started robbing people.  I never actually took anything myself.  I just tagged along for the adrenaline high.  Even at my lowest, part of me was always the same good kid.  I always held down a job.  I wrote poetry.  I kept dream journals.  Whenever we were getting into trouble, my friends would always tease me.  They’d say: ‘This isn’t you, man.  Why are you here?’  Hip-hop saved me.  It gave me a voice.  I started doing open mic nights.  I took all those dream journals and turned them into lyrics.  I joined a group called The Arsonists.  We toured all over Europe.  We pressed a lot of records.  Of course I always held down a second job.  My proudest moment was when they wrote about us in The Source.  My stage name was ‘Jise,’ in honor of my brother.  It was like I’d gotten us both there.
My English is not good.  Spoken English is very difficult.  But I want to study at Columbia so I am trying to improve.  I decided to come to America because of Forrest Gump.  I’ve watched the movie five times.  I like Forrest very much.  Forrest is very simple.  He picks one thing, and he keeps going.  When I was young, I thought Forrest was stupid.  But now I have a different view.  I think people are too complicated.  They complain about everything.  Forrest never complains.  Forrest chooses one thing and he keeps going.  I watched the movie last month to encourage me.  My life is hard because people don’t ever know what I’m saying.  But I just think of Forrest.  Forrest figured everything out because he just kept going.
My mother wasn’t the best person in the world.  She was hooked on heroin for most of my life.  She sold our childhood home for drug money.  She left me alone to raise my brother and disabled nephew.  I used to wake up every night to feed him and change his diapers.  I supported us all on the $5.15 an hour that I earned from the grocery store.  My mother passed away a few months ago, and I think I’m just now coming to terms with how awful she made my life.  This is the most stable I’ve ever been.  I have a permanent address.  I have someone who legitimately loves me.  But my anxiety has never been worse.  I’ve been having panic attacks recently.  I think I've never had to deal with the trauma because things were always coming at me.  And now I’m not sure how to handle the quiet.
                                                                                                                              Graduation weekend was a nightmare.  My parents haven’t spoken to each other since my dad had an affair.  Yet they both wanted to come to the ceremony.  So we spent the whole weekend together.  Except they didn’t speak a word to each other.  It was ninety percent silence and ten percent me talking about nothing.  The celebration dinner was the worst.  Nobody said a word.  I ended up drinking a lot of tequila.  I tried to fill the silence by commenting on every single dish on the menu.  I made several observations about my pasta.  Then I spent an hour ‘looking’ for the perfect dessert place on Yelp.  I’m pretty sure at some point I even pulled out the subway map and described how the entire system worked.
I lost my job last week.  I was there for six years.  It was the first job I’ve ever lost.  It’s hard not to take it personally when someone tells you that you’re not needed.  There were ten people on my team, and I’m the one they chose.  So my mind has been running through all the possible things I could have done wrong.  The first few days were the hardest.  I spent a lot of time crying.  But my birthday was a few days ago, and my friends took me out for a taco night.  And it woke me up.  I started laughing.  I couldn’t even remember why I'd felt so sad.   My life was so much bigger than that job.  I’m healthy, I live in a wonderful city, and I have a great group of friends.  I just lost a small piece of the pie.
I don’t think I’m going to miss eighth grade.  It’s been a tough year.  A lot of my friends are struggling with depression and self-harm, and it’s hard for me to watch.  I just care about them so much.  Growing up is so hard for some people.  It’s such a big thing.  It’s your foundation, I guess.  You’re becoming you.  It’s such a big thing and we’re going through it right now.  Some of my friends are struggling with loving themselves and loving life.  I think they forget that we’re still learning.  They think that they’re already who they’re going to be.  They think they know the future.  And it’s going to be horrible.  And they’ll never be able to fix it.  But that’s not true because we’re still changing.  And we’ll always be changing.  Even when we’re old, we’ll be changing.
I grew up in an abusive household where I never got any approval.  I always felt unattractive and gross.  But everything changed the first time I walked into a gay club.  Everyone turned to look at me.  I was the newest thing.   I felt like I could have anyone I wanted.  It was the first time in my life that I felt a sense of power, and I became addicted to it.  I started using sex as a way to satisfy my juvenile need for approval.  And that need didn’t go away when I found a long-term partner.  I tried to tell him about it one time.  We were walking in this park, and I told him about my strong desire to be with other people. I thought maybe if we could talk about my feelings, they would go away.  But he took it personally.  He teared up.  He looked like he’d been stabbed in the heart.  So I took it all back.  I never mentioned it again.  Until he caught me cheating on him.
I’m driving to pay off my student debts.  I had to start college late because my father had a stroke shortly after I graduated high school.  He couldn’t afford to stop working.  So I worked in a fried chicken restaurant seven days a week while he recovered. When he first came home from the hospital, I carried him down the stairs.  He had tears in his eyes.  My father emigrated from Pakistan in the eighties.  He worked hard so that I could have a better life.  In that moment, I think he saw that I’d turned into the son that he’d always hoped for.
I’m turning thirty in July.  And I’m still working out a lot of childish things in my dating life.  I’m learning how to communicate.  I’m learning to ask myself: ‘What do I want?’ instead of ‘What can I take?’  I’m learning that another person can never ‘complete me.’  And I’m learning that in certain moments it’s OK to not like somebody—even if you love them.  It’s taken me longer to figure this stuff out because I had to hide my identity for so long.  I know that nobody ever fully arrives, but heterosexuals definitely have a head start.
I’m practicing French right now.  I want to move to Europe so I can force myself to start over.  I have a nine-to-six job.  It’s a good position.  They pay me well.  I love my team.  But everything just feels so familiar.  There’s no discomfort or uncertainty anymore.  On weekends I go to the same neighborhood bar.  I eat at the same restaurants that I know are good.  I take interesting vacations, but even those tend to follow a regular pattern.  As much as I tell myself that I'm being adventurous when I hike in Peru—it’s a very planned risk.  I think a new city will be good for me.  I’ll start out alone.  I’ll be forced to reflect.  I’ll have a sense of unexpectedness.  I want to feel like a tourist in my own life again.
He’s an actor on Broadway.  I broke up with him in December because he couldn’t manage his anger.  He’d scream at me on subway platforms.  Once he busted my lip while trying to grab something out of my hand.  That was when I finally ended it.  But he called me on New Year’s Eve and asked if he could go to a party with me.  We’d bought our tickets months earlier.  They were expensive so I agreed.  My sister was coming with us so I wasn’t worried.  Everyone had a great time.  At the end of the night, we dropped off my sister and went back to his place.  I was so drunk that I curled up in a pile of clothes.  When I opened my eyes he was taking photos of me and laughing.  I immediately decided to leave.  It was literally the start of a new year and I wanted to begin on a good note.  He yelled at me to come back but I kept walking.  He followed me down the stairs and grabbed my arm.  He told me to ‘stop acting stupid.’  Then he pinned me up against the side of his building.  He was choking me and saying ‘calm down, calm down, calm down.’  A van drove by and started honking at us.  But they didn’t stop.  They didn’t help me.  I broke free and ran into traffic but nobody was stopping.  He caught me, and pushed me up against a van, and lifted me into the air by the neck.  When I woke up on the ground he was gone.  I asked the judge to sentence him to anger management courses.  He's finished them.  But I’m still dealing with the trauma of that night.
’I’m obsessive, but my obsessions are productive.  I’m happy.  I never get depressed.  I find life very interesting.  I paint for hours every day.   I have 100,000 postcards at home organized geographically.  And I’ve written a story about every day of my life between 1981 and 2011.  I have 20,000 pages of notes.  Right now I’m in the editing phase.  I’ll be done with that in a couple years, and then I’m going to copy the entire thing by hand.  There's no way I can  trust computers with something this important.  I think I can finish the job in ten years.  I’m pretty sure I can live long enough.
I asked her out during a movie.  I was really nervous, so I executed with about half the talent level that I could have. I accidentally swallowed some cologne in the bathroom because I tried to open the packet with my mouth.  Then I never actually had the courage to ask the question.  I waited until there was a scene in the movie with a boyfriend and girlfriend, and I said: ‘That could be us.’  It felt good coming out of my mouth.  But then I looked over and saw confusion.  But I rode out the awkward silence, and eventually she figured it out.
I just had to sit down because I got short of breath. I was at a restaurant earlier where the manager had to seat me at the counter because I couldn’t fit in the booth.  I have pain in my knees and my joints. I sleep with a breathing apparatus at night.  And I’m a great candidate for a heart attack.  I hate it.  I hate the way I feel.  But I’ve been overweight for so long that people assume I don’t want to lose weight.  Friends and family wonder why I don’t just stop eating.  But it’s an addiction for me.  When I walk past a bakery, I feel the same way that an alcoholic must feel when he walks past a bar.  But people seem to think that the alcoholic is unable to quit.  And they think I choose not to.
I grew up outside of Miami. It wasn’t easy to be young, black, and gay in my neighborhood. It was a very masculine space. All the guys played basketball or football. They wore oversize clothes. There was a clearly defined idea of what it meant to be a man. And I spent a lot of energy trying to meet that standard. I didn’t like sports but I played anyway. If I ever got bullied for acting feminine, or hanging out with girls, I’d take it to the extreme and insist on fighting. The black man is expected to be a rock. I think it comes from our history. We were abused for so long, I think there’s a resistance to ever being vulnerable again.
Having a child was the best thing that ever happened to us.  But it is constant company with terrible conversation.
I feel like I’m just starting, but I think I’d be fine if it all went away.  I get that from my mother.  From the moment I started singing, she always reminded me that all of this was a privilege, and could be taken at any moment.  So singing is not how I define myself.  I try to keep my identity rooted in my friendships and my faith.
She has the biggest heart.  Everyone sees her success as an athlete, but all of that is layered on the size of her heart.  She gives 100% of herself to everything she does: as a friend, as a lover, and soon, as a mother.
He’s so sexy.  And he taught me the importance of being silly. Being silly is so important.  Silly is the opposite of grief.  It’s throwing yourself into a moment without care.  You can’t always maintain your status as a dignified person it gives you blinders. When you always expect the world to fulfill your expectations, it wears you down.  It closes you off. So sexy.
She always responds with empathy.  She meets anger with empathy.  She meets hate with empathy.  She’ll take the time to imagine what happened to a person when they were five or six years old.  And she’s made me a more empathetic person.  I had a very fractured relationship with my father.  Before he died, she made me remember things I didn’t want to remember.  She made me remember the good times.
They try to manipulate me.  But I’ve got it figured out.  A hug in the morning is normal.  A hug at night is normal.  A hug for no reason means that we saw something we want on television.(Lima, Peru)
I live with my mom and uncles.  There are twelve of us in one house.  Everyone is sacrificing so that I can go to university.  My mom works in restaurants and cleans houses.  All her money goes to my tuition.  She always tells me just to focus on school.  We were short on money last semester, but she told me: ‘Don’t worry about it.  I’ll find it.  You just continue.’  She’s always been like that.  She never wants me to be stressed.  My dad passed away when I was a young child.  So we’ve always struggled.  Sometimes when I was growing up, there would only be enough for one meal.  And my mom always said that she wasn’t hungry.  I didn’t realize until I was older that she had only been pretending.(Lima, Peru)
I knew my husband very well.  We’d been living together for twenty-one years.  So it was obvious that something was going on.  Suddenly he started playing guitar and writing songs.  The songs were OK, but I read some of the lyrics and they clearly weren’t written for me.  He started wearing cologne.  He started liking new foods that he’d never even tried before.  So I was suspicious.  Then one night he came home crying.  I said: ‘What happened?  Did you kill someone?’  He told me that he’d gotten a girl pregnant.  She’d just had the baby and didn’t want to keep it.  Then he asked me if I would raise it!  I said: ‘Sure, give it to me.’  I arranged to meet the woman in the park, and she handed me the boy.  He was only three days old.  He felt like my son the moment I held him.  I got rid of my husband a few months later.  But I kept the baby.  He’s sixteen now.  (Lima, Peru)
He’s always acting so serious.  The last time we went out with my friends, he looked like he was constipated the entire time. (Lima, Peru)
I’ve been sitting here for three hours trying to figure out what to do.  I need to make a sale.  Rent is due in a week and I don’t have the money.  I’m already starting to miss payments on a loan I took out recently.  I made two cold calls today and both of them went like shit.  I’d never do anything bad to get money, but who knows.  I’m beginning to dread going home.  My kids are small and want to be with me all the time, but I’m so stressed that I have no patience.  I’ve been losing my temper easily.  We were at my brother-in-law’s house this weekend, and he’s doing much better than I am.  His kids have a bunch of toys.  My son kept begging me to buy the same stupid little toy truck that his cousin had.  And I yelled at him to forget it.  I only had enough money in my pocket to get us home.(Lima, Peru)
I’m about to meet up with my ex-girlfriend.  We broke up two weeks ago and I’m hoping to get back together with her.  I restricted her freedom too much.  I scheduled all our classes together.  I always wanted to know where she was.  It all started a year ago when she cheated on me.  She called me immediately afterwards and confessed.  But ever since then, anytime she’s away from me, I always imagine the worst.  She goes out with friends and some of them are male.  So it’s hard for me to not get suspicious.  And if I get suspicious, she gets nervous.  Which makes me even more suspicious.(Lima, Peru)


We're talking about how important it is to take a shower every day." (Lima, Peru)


My mission is to get them interested in Star Wars. My only chance is to get the big one hooked first because that’s how my kids work. I pitched Princess Leia as the most important character. I might have told a little lie and said that she was the princess of the entire galaxy. We had our first attempt the other day. I got whiplash checking to see if they were still awake, and I lost both of them before Princess Leia even showed up. I have faith in George Lucas though. We’re scheduling another screening with lots of candy. I think if we can just stay awake for the entire movie, we’ll be ready for The Empire Strikes Back.(Lima, Peru)

I’m starting from nothing. I lost everything back in Venezuela. I had my own natural soap factory but the crisis made it impossible to get ingredients. Then the government began to take 70% of my earnings. I had to close it down. Things got so bad that I couldn’t even find food for my baby. I had a little money, but there was nowhere to buy food. I’d wait in line all day for one bag of flour. We could go days without eating. When I tried to breastfeed my daughter, I’d almost faint. Leaving the country was my only chance. I’d never said ‘goodbye’ to my daughter before. She was screaming my name when I left. It hurt worse than giving birth. But I didn’t have a choice. I told her that I was going to Colombia. I told her that I was going to make a diamond, and I’d bring it back to her. Now I sell key chains in the street. When I make some money, I send packets of food back home. I’m trying to keep a good spirit. I’m doing OK. I grew up very poor. I came from nothing. So I’ve been here before.(Bogotá, Colombia)My interpreter Juan has kept in touch with Rose, and we put together a small fundraiser if anyone would like to help:


I didn’t even start gambling until I was 43. I thought I was mature, but I was as vulnerable as a child. I started going to the casino once or twice on the weekends. It was a social thing. I’d just play cards with my friends. But I had good luck in the beginning. I started to win. And I started to love it. I couldn’t wait for the weekend. Soon I started to go during the week. I’d work the early shift and I’d have all afternoon to play. I abandoned all my responsibilities. Once you start playing you forget that you’re hungry, you forget that you’re thirsty, you even forget that you have a family. I lost the grocery money, the rent money, everything. Winning felt great. And losing made me need to win. I’d make up excuses every time I came home empty handed. I’d say that I was mugged, or that my work hadn’t paid us that week. Eventually I had to sell my car. I lost our house. I lost my wife. We’d been together for twenty years. I just took for granted that she’d always be around. The only thing that I didn’t lose was my daughters. They sat me down one day, and said: ‘Dad, either quit gambling, or quit this house.’ And I never played again. (Medellín, Colombia)




Sometimes I’d start crying in class for no reason. Then when I got home from school, I’d just go straight to my room. I couldn’t even talk to my mom about it because I’d just start crying. People would tell me: ‘Just get up, exercise, and take a walk.’ But none of that helped. Things got so bad that even the school was watching me. I started bawling during a chemistry exam and I ended up in the school psychologist office. I remember thinking: ‘I don’t care if I ever see another chemistry exam again. Or my friends. Or my mom.’ And I started to get this feeling that I was definitely going to do it. I was going to lock myself in my room that night and take a bunch of pills. The only thing that stopped me was imagining my mom finding my body. That was three years ago. That time seems so far away now. I found a great therapist. I learned so much about myself. There’s so much that I want to do now. I want to travel. I want to get married. I want to have kids. There are so many poems that I haven’t written and songs I haven’t heard. So it’s terrifying for me to think that I came so close. My problems were small back then. They were teenage problems. But I came one step away from not being. And I had made the decision to take that step. I’m afraid that I can go back to that place again. And next time, my problems will probably not be so small.(Bogotá, Colombia)




(3/3) The night I deserted was the most frightening moment of my life. The guerrillas would have killed me if I’d been discovered. I ran away in the middle of the night. I found a road and hitched a ride with an oil truck from Ecuador. I tried to cross the border but the army arrested me. I thought for sure I would be executed. But they gave me the chance to demobilize. The first thing I wanted to do was see my family. It was too dangerous to return home so I sent for them. I thought my father would push me away, but he was very happy to see me. My sisters told me that my disappearance had been very hard on him. He had gotten very sick. I’ll always live with that regret, but we were able to spend four years together before he passed away. I’ve rebuilt my life from scratch. Leaving the guerrillas was like being born again. I had no skills. There was a lot of prejudice against me. I had to work as a waitress and go to school at night. But I’m almost finished with law school now. And even though it took a lot of suffering to get here, I finally have the life that I imagined as a young girl.(Bogotá, Colombia)


(2/3) I was the youngest one in the camp. I felt very happy at first. I didn’t have to cook anymore. I was having new experiences. The guerrillas taught me rules. They taught me how to use weapons. They told me that we were fighting for the poor. All of it sounded very good. But then basic training began and it was very difficult. I started to miss my family. My father’s birthday came around, and I could not stop thinking about him. They sent me to another camp because my father kept searching for me. I spent eight years with the guerillas. We lived in the mountains. I slept on the ground. I didn’t get a salary. The fighting was continuous. The army would bomb us day and night. And I didn’t speak to my family for a full seven years. I always wondered what happened to them. Finally it got to be too much, and I decided to desert. (Bogotá, Colombia)




(1/3) I knew nothing about the guerrillas before I joined them. The only thing I knew was that they lived better than me. I grew up on a farm in a rural area. We were very poor. My mother abandoned our family so I had to take care of my younger siblings. My father was a good man, but he didn’t give me any liberties. He didn’t let me go to town. He didn’t let me go to school. He didn’t let me have a boyfriend. I wanted freedom, and the guerrillas seemed like my only way out. They used to drive by our farm in their jeeps. They seemed powerful. Even the women wore camouflage. One day the guerrillas stopped by our farm to buy some chickens, and I told them I wanted to join. I was only thirteen years old. They told me to meet them at a certain spot at 5 AM the next morning. I didn’t even say ‘goodbye’ to my father. They told me that I was never allowed to speak to my family again. (Bogotá, Colombia)


We’ve been at war in this country for over fifty years. There have been hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of victims. So a lot of people don’t like the work that I do. I manage a reintegration program for ex-combatants. I’m trying to take away the main tool of war human beings. We can’t punish everyone who fought against us. We can’t jail them all. That will only divide us further. So we must find a way to reconcile with the 60,000 ex-combatants that live among us. We must educate them. We must find them jobs. If we reject and stigmatize them, we will always be at war. Reconciliation is a very hard task. There are a lot of open wounds in this country. People don’t want to forgive. Ex-combatants are often viewed as monsters. My job is to show that their blood is like ours. If we can’t break the idea of ‘good’ and ‘evil,’ we will always be divided. Reconciliation is the only way to change the course of our history. (Bogotá, Colombia)




I’m unemployed right now, but it’s my own decision. I’m trying to rethink my life. I’ve been a biology teacher for the past seven years. I’d wake up at 5:30 AM every day and wouldn’t get home until after 5 PM. Then I’d spend the evening preparing lessons or grading exams. Teaching was beautiful but I didn’t like the philosophy of the school. The focus was on being as productive as possible. The kids were stressed. They had no time to be children. I just didn’t feel that life should be like that. It can’t always be about growing, growing, growing. There have to be cycles. So I’m trying to take a step back. I’m trying to enrich myself without having an exact objective. I’m reading, and doing yoga, and participating in a dance group. But it’s been hard to appreciate the moment. I’ve always felt such a pressure to work. And when I’m not producing, it’s hard to escape the feeling that I’m doing something wrong. (Bogotá, Colombia)




My father never valued my mother. She did everything for him. She worked all day, then she came home to cook dinner. My father just came home to sleep. She’d bring him his food on a tray. Everything had to be perfect: right colors, right napkins, everything. But he’d still call her names. He’d get drunk and yell at her for nothing. My mother was submissive and accepted it all. She’d even get mad at me if I tried to intervene. Eventually my father had an affair with our neighbor. And two years ago he left our home to be with her. Recently I spoke to him on the phone. He sounded depressed. He’d just broken up with the woman. He told me that he’d given her everything, but she still left him. He’d cooked for her, he’d treated her well, and he’d bought her whatever she wanted. But nothing was enough. I asked him if he realized what life was teaching him. He had no answer.(Bogotá, Colombia)


I’m really bothered by people using cocaine. I get angry when I see people doing it for fun. So many horrible things have happened in my country just so people can have ‘fun.’ Cocaine was the motor behind the war in Colombia. It financed the drug lords, the paramilitary, and the guerillas. It paid for the bombs, and the guns, and the kidnappings. It corrupted our government. It ruined our reputation. There isn’t a family in Colombia that hasn’t been hurt. All of us lost friends and family members. And this violence was funded by people who use cocaine. Yet none of them feel responsible for what happened.(Bogotá, Colombia)




My mother abandoned me as an infant. My father left when I was seven, and a year later I began working as a maid. My earliest memories are cooking and cleaning. When I turned seventeen, I got a job on a construction site. I met a much older man there. I thought he was very handsome. And he was so nice to me. He’d bring me flowers, and apples, and oranges. If anyone was aggressive toward me, he would defend me. He made me feel whole. It was the first time that I’d ever felt truly happy. When I found out I was pregnant, I was so excited to tell him. I thought I would finally have a family. He’d always told me that he wanted to be with me. But when I gave him the news, he said: ‘I have a wife and children. We can never be together.’ Even now it hurts to remember. It hurt me more than not having parents.(Medellín, Colombia)




My sister was murdered when I was twelve years old. Her husband killed her because of jealousy. After that it was just me and my mom. I stopped studying. I became the black sheep of the family. I left the house and went my own way. There was a gang in the neighborhood. They gave me a place to live. They gave me work. They gave me marijuana and cocaine. I was always high. My job was tocollect protection money from local businesses. There were five of us who made the rounds. When I turned fourteen they told me I was ready to ‘test the knife.’ There was a shopkeeper named Maria. Her husband was a pain in the ass. He would always scream at us and call us sons of bitches. So we stabbed him over and over. There was blood everywhere. I felt like throwing up. Afterwards I felt empty inside. So I just did more drugs. And the way I looked at it—if my sister got killed, why shouldn’t other people die? At least that’s how I always justified it to myself. (Bogotá, Colombia)




We've been dating for a year and a half. It’s been a wonderful relationship but recently it’s changed a lot. I feel like I’m the one holding it together. I’m the one that calls. I’m the one that texts. We used to talk every day, but now she’s not even trying. Maybe she just feels smothered. Maybe she’s testing to see if I’ll stick around. I just don’t know. I can’t decipher what she wants. When I ask her directly, her answers are never precise. She keeps saying: ‘I’ll think about it.’ So I keep giving her one last try—over and over again. I just want to get things back to the way they used to be. (Bogotá, Colombia)




I gave the last nine years of my life to my job. It was all I did. My work made me feel ‘needed.’ I was an accountant and I could do things that nobody else could do. My bosses kept telling me how important I was to the company. But one day they asked me to ‘touch up’ some numbers to make them look better. And I realized I was giving them way more of my time than they deserved—so I quit. The first thing I did was rest. The second thing I did was repair the relationships that I’d been neglecting. I reached out to old friends. I arranged to be with them physically, and not just over texts or Facebook. At first I was nervous because I didn’t know what we’d talk about. It had been so long. But it was easy. One of them had just gotten a scholarship. Another was becoming a father. So much had happened in their lives that I had missed. It felt so good to reconnect. For nine years I’d been focusing on numbers. It wasn’t real. Now I’m connecting with people again, and I feel like my feet are back on the ground. (Bogotá, Colombia)


I didn’t even really like animals. But my daughter said she wanted a pet. So I brought home this kitten, and told my daughter: ‘It’s your responsibility. I’m not going to get involved.’ But now the kitten loves me more than the girl. I call him JJ. He’s always the first one to greet me when I come home. When I leave for work, he lays on my flip-flops by the door. He always wants to be with me. Right now we’re coming back from a trip to the store. My daughter is a little jealous. She’s always trying to steal him from me. (Medellín, Colombia)




It was a slip. The first thing I thought about was an abortion. I was only fifteen at the time. But after getting my ear chewed off, and all of the bitching, and all of the scolding, I decided to take responsibility. My daughter is three now. I’ve had to give up so much. I can’t go to university. I can’t go out, or go on trips. Now my life is nothing but a routine. I’m a slave to paying rent. I work seven days a week at a casino for minimum wage. I have to support my grandmother and sisters. My mother left the house in December to live with a man. I never talk about any of this. I keep to myself because nobody cares. Even if I’m happy—nobody cares. I only worry about my daughter’s happiness. I only think about her future. I have hope for her. But not for me. (Medellín, Colombia)


There was a lot of sickness in my house. My wife has heart problems and is connected to oxygen. I was drinking a lot. Everyone kept to themselves and stayed in their rooms. But one day I had a prophecy in the church that I would have a very big happiness. The prophecy said that someone was going to come and fill all the voids of my home. A few weeks later my daughter was pregnant. And here he is! He’s consumed my entire life. I get to watch him every afternoon. I want him to see me as the happy grandpa who never says ‘no.’ I don’t even drink anymore. He’s brought our entire family together. Recently my wife told me: ‘I can tell you are so happy. Your eyes are always sparkling now.’ (Medellín, Colombia)




I’m a single father. I’ve had my son since he was two. His mother and I used to consume a lot of drugs, but I did a full stop when he was born. He saved my life in a lot of ways. But his mother never got her life together. She’ll show up sporadically but then disappear for months at a time. I try to fill in the holes with as much love as possible, but I know it bothers him. He’s just not at an age where he can fully express his feelings. I try to protect him from all the volatility of my own life. I broke up with my girlfriend yesterday. And I’m sitting here wondering how I’m going to explain it to him. I actually waited a long time before introducing them because I didn’t want her to be another absence in his life. But now it didn’t work out. And I’ve got to figure out how to break that down for him.(Bogotá, Colombia)




I want to be an archeologist. That’s a person who explores the desert and looks for dinosaur eggs and Egyptians. I’ve been thinking a lot about it. I’m already watching Jurassic Park and collecting dinosaur stickers. And once I found a piece of coral in the shape of a heart.(Bogotá, Colombia)




I met him at the company where we worked. We went out dancing. He was kind to me. Things started changing after we got married. I’d rush home from work so I could cook for the whole family. But if the food wasn’t ready on time, he’d get upset. One day his mistress came to the door to tell me about their affair. I was pregnant at the time. He came back from work and found her in the house, and he hit me so hard that he broke my face. I still have the scars. The abuse got worse and worse. I stayed for a long time. At first I thought marriages were supposed to be like that. And by the time I learned otherwise, he wouldn’t let me go. He’d lock me in the house. He’d threaten me by putting a gun to our son’s head. When I finally got a restraining order, I was in such bad shape that I checked into a mental institution. Now I’m alone and it’s the happiest time of my life. I’m able to work. I can eat whatever I want. I can go out whenever I want. Even sitting here and smoking a cigarette is a joy for me.(Bogotá, Colombia)




I’ve been sitting here for four hours thinking about what I should do. I don’t want to go home. I fucked up again. I’ve been a drug addict my whole life. But I was clean for three months. I got a job at a call center. I was doing well. Then as soon as I got my paycheck, I went out drinking with some coworkers. Just a normal thing. But then I tried a little coke, went on a binge, and lost my job. Same story as always. And now I don’t want to go home. I live with my mother. She’s never lost faith in me. My brother was killed in the army so I’m her only son. She doesn’t deserve this. She was so happy that I had a job. She’d convinced herself that things were finally going to be OK. And I’ve got to go home and tell her what happened. And I don’t want to do it. She’s not even going to be mad. She’ll just be so hurt. Then she’ll ask me if I’ve eaten. (Bogotá, Colombia)




I was the best student in my high school. I put so much pressure on myself. I never failed a class. But I got sick during 10th grade and I started to fall behind. That’s when the panic attacks began. One day the teacher handed me my grade report, and I couldn’t breathe. My heart was beating very fast. I felt disconnected. I saw people trying to talk to me but I couldn’t hear them. Eventually I passed out and woke up in the infirmary. The attacks were almost daily after that. Last year I started college. And I can’t be the best student here no matter how hard I try. Everyone is so talented. My panic attacks got so bad that I had to cancel my first semester. But now I’m working on acknowledging my anxiety. I used to try to hide it. I would log off social media. I wouldn’t answer calls. I thought that if nobody knew, it didn’t exist. But the more I talk about my problem, the more I realize that other people experience similar things. So I’m trying to express it more. I had a great teacher who told me: ‘Instead of letting anxiety keep you from doing your art, let it be the thing that motivates your art.’ (Bogotá, Colombia)




I do yoga at the senior center. But it’s not advanced enough for me. I can do the cat, the dog, the bridge, the snake… all of it. My class is filled with younger people in their sixties and seventies. They are always complaining: ‘My hip! My diabetes!’ But you’ll never hear a word out of me. (Medellín, Colombia)




We’re doing great now. But this time last year we found a tumor on her spine and lungs. She seemed like a perfectly healthy child just like now. But one day she had a very bad episode of pneumonia. And the doctors told us it was cancer. But Carolina was so brave the entire time. She made us so proud. She wasn’t afraid of the doctors. She stuck out her arm when it was time for treatment. She was even brave during the surgery. It was over before Carolina even realized—wasn’t it? But those were the longest four hours of Mommy’s life. (Montevideo, Uruguay)


I didn’t find out that I liked teaching until I was 45 years old. I was working as a graphic designer, and I volunteered to teach a group of kids from a poor region. It was part of a special program aimed at teenagers who’d dropped out of school. At first I was scared. Many of them had behavior problems. Some of them were addicted to drugs. One of them even brought a knife to class. But I discovered that I could really connect with them. Sometimes I could even reach kids that refused to talk to psychologists. I learned that I could transform someone’s life just by listening. The program only lasted six months, but it gave me such sense of satisfaction. I’ve been training for the last two years to become a real teacher. My test results just arrived and I got assigned to the school I wanted. I’m going to teach Portuguese to elementary school students.(Montevideo, Uruguay)




I was thirteen when my mother started to change. My parents had just gotten divorced. My mother should have been sad but she kept going out to dance. Sometimes she’d stay out all night. She became very talkative and had a hard time concentrating. She’d say that she wanted to sell everything and travel the world. Then she got depressed. She stayed in her room. She gained a lot of weight. I actually preferred the depression, because at least then she’d stay at home. The manic phases got worse and worse. They are so bad now that she has to go to the clinic. Then the depression will come again and she can’t stop crying. Last October she returned to her normal self. It lasted about a week. I didn’t leave her side. We took walks every day. I always tell her that she gave us the best childhood. She was always there for us. She made crafts with us. She taught me how to cook. She would even throw birthday parties for my toys. I still think I’m very lucky. I hate seeing her like this, but she’s still the best mom in the world.(Montevideo, Uruguay)




I grew up in Spain right after the civil war. When I was eleven I was sent to a Catholic boarding school. They fed me and sheltered me. But they only taught me religion. They were training me to be a priest. I was taught to fear God. I was taught to fear the outside world. I was taught to fear everything. I left the grounds one day when I was twenty-eight. I went to a barbershop and got my hair cut by a French woman. I had never really spoken to a woman before. She told me I was cute. That same day I bought a newspaper. It was the first time I’d ever bought something with my own money. When I returned to the school, I was changed. I had discovered freedom. I began to realize their lies and so I wasn’t useful to them anymore. A few months later I met a woman in church and fell in love. We got married and had three children. I left all of it behind, except for the fear. Sometimes I still feel very afraid for no reason. That will always be a part of me. (Montevideo, Uruguay)




I have Asperger’s, but I wasn’t diagnosed for a long time. I was a polite child. I found it easy to concentrate at school. I had some problems socializing but that’s pretty normal for children. But my problem is that I’m too transparent. I kept trying to fix people. I could never just stand aside and let things be. I kept telling people what was wrong with their lives. I thought I was helping them. I just wanted everything to be in order. But I accidentally stirred up so much negativity. Now I’m sometimes afraid to talk to people. I don’t want to cause any problems. There’s no danger in what I just said is there? (Montevideo, Uruguay)




In twenty minutes I lost what I had been building for forty years. It happened while I was at work. My mother tried to turn on the stove and it caught fire. I lost everything. All my possessions and photographs were destroyed. Everything seemed hopeless. I didn’t sleep for many nights after it happened. But so many people came to help me. My friends let me live with them for months. My neighbors helped me clean the site and we began to rebuild. People were giving me extra materials. Twenty-five volunteers showed up from the local construction union. The experience changed me. I see people differently now. I thought that the world was full of people asking for things that they didn’t need. So I just focused on taking care of myself. As soon as my house is finished, I’m doing whatever I can to help people. (Montevideo, Uruguay)




She keeps bringing home animals. I try to tell her that our house is too small for more pets. She keeps saying, ‘Our house is small but our hearts are big.’ She brings them home while I’m working. Then by the time I get home, the kids have already given them names, and there’s nothing I can do. It started with one bird. But then the bird got ‘lonely.’ So now we have four birds. And eleven hamsters. And rabbits. And fish. Now she's started texting me pictures of dogs that don’t have a home. It’s only a matter of time. (Montevideo, Uruguay)


I downsized my life to one large suitcase, and I’ve been traveling non-stop for seven years. Everyone’s happy. My ex-wife got the real estate. And I got my peace.(Montevideo, Uruguay)




(2/2) It’s very difficult to talk about adoption on the Internet. No matter what you say, somebody will say the opposite. We adopted Axel last January. He had spent three years in the orphanage. The staff loved him and were desperate to find him a family. We were the only ones on the list for an older child. We knew it was going to be difficult. I had read a lot of literature on the difficulties of overcoming early neglect. And we’re making progress. We’re teaching him that our home is a permanent home. We are learning that touch is a good thing. We are learning that hugs can make you feel better. And I’m learning to not put so much pressure on myself. At first we felt so much pressure to love him. It would hurt me when he didn’t want to be hugged. I wanted to immediately love him as much as our biological son. And I felt guilty because it wasn’t happening right away. But then I stopped pressuring myself. My husband and I decided to focus on basics. We focused on providing food, shelter, and education. And once we stopped pressuring ourselves to feel a certain way, we discovered that we already loved him quite a bit. It’s a rollercoaster. But I feel like we’re heading up. Adopting an older child is difficult, but every child is difficult. My biological child was difficult. Only this time, after several months, I’m sleeping through the night, my boobs don’t hurt, and I don’t smell like diapers. So I feel like I should be doing a victory dance.(Santiago, Chile)




One thing that makes me most proud of Humans of New York is the warmth of the comment section. There are exceptions of course, but generally the responses to each story are thoughtful and encouraging. I joke that Humans of New York is followed by the nicest 25 million people on the Internet. Often the comment section will takes on a life and a narrative of it's own. During my visit to Santiago, I received an email from a woman named Victoria (aka Sofia) who shared a story about how her life was changed by the support of the HONY community. Very proud to pass it along: - We’d been trying to adopt for several years. We didn’t want an infant. The waiting list was too long. Plus we had one child already, so we’d already been through the experience of having a baby. We wanted other couples to have that opportunity. So we decided to adopt an older child. But everything went wrong. Our application was invalidated after three years because my husband got a job in Ecuador. When we tried to start over, the government went on strike. Then we lost all our possessions in a storage facility fire. So I was about to give up. I couldn’t do it anymore. The process was stressing me out so much that it was affecting my biological child. Then right when I was about to give up, I saw a Humans of New York post about a man who’d grown up in a group home. I thought: ‘He could have been my child.’ I wrote about my difficulties in the comment section, and hundreds of people responded. Everyone told me not to give up. My phone was buzzing all day. The ones that touched me most were the stories from adopted children. It gave me the strength to go on. (Santiago, Chile)




(3/3) The doctors discovered a tumor on Mom’s spine in 2007. She spent four years being really sick. First she couldn’t walk. Then she couldn’t move her arms, or her hands. When she died she could only move her head. My father took care of her. I don’t think there was emotion involved. I think he was just concerned about doing the correct thing. He’d openly say: ‘I hate this so much.’ But he did it. Mom died three years ago. When she realized she didn’t have much time, she really encouraged me to get closer to my siblings. She also encouraged me to travel. She’d say: ‘Go explore. Forget about me. You’re different. I want you to find people like you.’ She was always so worried about me being alone. And sometimes I do feel alone now that she’s gone. I don’t know who to call when I accomplish something. I miss her so much. But I always try to be like her. My whole life I’ve tried to be like her. I can be shy. I can isolate myself. Sometimes I remind myself of my father. But I have always tried to be my mother. (Santiago, Chile)




(2/3) One day I found a box of old love letters that my dad had written to my mom. They were romantic letters. They said nice things. I was surprised because I’d never seen him say those things. All of that had disappeared before I was born. My father had never told me anything about himself. Everything I know about him, I learned from my mom. She told me that the romance had been an act. She told me that she later realized he was a very cold man. But Mom always told me that we shouldn’t blame him. She said he had a very rough childhood. His father abandoned the family when he was very young. His mother married another man, and sent him to live with an uncle. She raised an entirely new family and left my father behind. He had a very lonely childhood. So my mother always told me: ‘You must not blame your father.’ She told me that always. Especially after she got sick.(Santiago, Chile)




(1/3) In every sense she was the perfect mom. She always tried to encourage me when I was younger. I was really shy, so she always worried about me being alone. She would ask things like: ‘Have you met anyone at school?’ or ‘Does anyone like the same things you do?’ She always knew when something was wrong. I never had to tell her anything. But Dad was the opposite. He ignored me. He never did anything wrong. He wasn’t an alcoholic. He wasn’t violent. He was just nothing—like a chair or a piece of furniture. His only idea of fatherhood was going to work. He never reacted to anything in my life. Not the good things, or the bad things. He didn’t react to me staying out late. He didn’t react when I experimented with drugs and alcohol. I made my mom very sad by trying to get my dad’s attention. A few years ago I got hit by a car. When I woke up from my coma, I called home to tell my parents what happened. My father answered the phone. I told him everything. All he said was: ‘Your mother is asleep right now. You can call her tomorrow.’ That hurt me worse than being hit by the car. (Santiago, Chile)




The older my daughters get, the more indifferent they become towards me. They don’t call me. They don’t come see me. They don’t do anything unless I try. I left the house when the oldest was six. I found a new partner. Their mother was very angry so she restricted my visits. Now they are teenagers and they seem so distant from me. I have nobody in my life right now. I have nobody to share things with, so I’d really like a relationship with them. But nothing seems to work. I pick them up from school. I speak to them every day. I try to take them to my apartment a couple times each week. But even if they are physically with me, it’s like they aren’t there. They don’t even say ‘I love you.’ It hurts. I guess they are still angry that I left. Maybe one day they will have their own relationships. And if they fail, they’ll learn that everything can’t be perfect. (Santiago, Chile)




He gets emotional when he drinks. He starts crying every time an animal dies on the nature shows." I can't help it. I'm a Pisces." (Santiago, Chile)


I came out at the age of twenty. I was trying to understand myself. It was a discovery time. I was thin and flexible. I loved to dance. I started performing in a trans show at a gay club. I wore high heels and sang Janet Jackson songs. It was wonderful. I did my own choreography. My friend Carlos designed my costumes. Carlos didn’t charge me money. He wanted me to be a success. We weren’t lovers or anything. He was more like an older brother. He was huge, and coarse, and a little bit of a bully. One night I was waiting backstage and Carlos came running into the green room. He told me that there was a fire and we needed to leave. He had been standing by the exit when the fire broke out, but he still came back to get me. We ran down a dark hallway to the emergency exit. The hallway was filled with smoke and there was a crowd of people pressed against the door. They couldn’t get it open. It was chained from the outside. Carlos lifted me up on top of the crowd, and people began passing me forward. It was completely dark. I held Carlos’s hand for as long as possible. Someone broke a window and I got pulled into the street. I was completely naked because so many people had been grabbing my clothes. When I finally turned around, I saw the whole club engulfed in flames. Over twenty people died that night. Carlos was one of them. (Valparaíso, Chile)




Our first house was destroyed by an earthquake in 1970. We barely made it out alive. We lost everything. I was only nineteen. He was twenty-two. We had two young babies and a third one on the way. When we found this place, it was just an abandoned lot. We built our house from the ground up. We lived in a tent and tried to save on everything. We carried wood and stones up the hill by ourselves. We collected free sand from far away. We barely slept. It took us a year to build. And we’ve been adding to it ever since. (Valparaíso, Chile)


The only time my mother spoke to us was when she was drunk. And she’d tell us we were unwanted. She convinced me to drink with her when I was ten. She told me that it would make me feel better. I started smoking crack when I was twelve. I never learned to read or write. I lost my entire childhood. My friends and I would break into cars, steal whatever we could, and use the money to buy more. It made me feel good and I wanted to feel good all the time. And nobody ever tried to stop me.(Santiago, Chile)
